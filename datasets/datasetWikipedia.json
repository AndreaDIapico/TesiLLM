Ramsey (29 May 191823 February 2016) was a United States Army officer who served in World War II and the Vietnam War.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born on 29 May 1918 in Somerset, Kentucky, the youngest of three brothers. He attended the University of Kentucky graduating in 1940.\n\nMilitary career\nHe enlisted in the Army in May 1940. In November 1942 he was serving with the 39th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division when it was deployed to French North Africa in Operation Torch.\n\nIn February 1943 he was appointed as Aide-de-camp to General Harold Alexander. For performance of this role he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\n\nIn November 1943 he was reassigned to the 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. In February 1944 he was appointed commander of the 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment at Anzio. The 3rd Infantry Division was later withdrawn from Italy and then deployed in Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France in August 1944.\n\nOn 7 September 1944 his command post at Besançon was attacked by a German force. Corporal Robert D. Maxwell fell on a German hand grenade absorbing the blast with his body and saving Ramsey from serious injury. Maxwell was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.\n\nIn early May 1945 his 3rd Battalion and the 1st Battalion were ordered by Regiment commander Colonel John A. Heintges to capture the Berchtesgaden, Adolf Hitler’s mountain retreat which they successfully achieved on 4 May. Ramsey initially refused to allow General Philippe Leclerc to cross a bridge into the area until he received confirmation that the 7th Regiment had captured Berchtesgaden. \n\nHe was assigned to the Infantry School as an instructor in 1946, he then served with the War Department General Staff. He attended Command and General Staff College in 1949-1950. In 1954 he was appointed as deputy, and later as Secretary, of the Joint Staff of the United Nations Command and Far East Command. In 1957 he was transferred to Fort Benning where he commanded the 14th Infantry Regiment and then the 1st Infantry Brigade. In September 1958 he became the G-1 of the U.S. Army Infantry Center. In July 1959 he was assigned  to South Korea and served as the U.S. Army Advisor to the Korean National Defense College until August 1960. He returned to the Department of the Army General Staff in September 1960, serving in the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison. In April 1963, he became executive officer of the Office, Assistant Chief of Staff for Force Development. On 1 March 1966 he was appointed Deputy Chief of Information under Brigadier General Keith L. Ware. \n\nIn December 1968 he was appointed deputy commander of 1st Logistics Command in South Vietnam.\n\nOn 1 June 1969 he was appointed as commander of the 23rd Infantry Division. The Mỹ Lai massacre, conducted by units of the division, became public in November 1969 and he assisted the military commission headed by General William R. Peers in its investigation.\n\nOn 17 March 1970 his command and control helicopter crashed into jungle approximately  west of Chu Lai Base Area killing two onboard and wounding him and others, the survivors were eventually rescued 18 hours later. Due to his injuries he was evacuated to the U.S. and replaced as division commander by Major general Albert E. Milloy. \n\nOn 14 July 1970 he was appointed United States Army Provost Marshal General and he served in that role until 20 May 1974 when the role was abolished.\n\nHe retired from the Army on 1 August 1974.\n\nLater life\nHe died on 25 February 2016 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nDecorations\nHis decorations include Distinguished Service Medal (2), Silver Star (3), Legion of Merit (2), Distinguished Flying Cross and Bronze Star (4), Purple Heart (5), Air Medal (17),  Gallantry Cross with Palm, Armed Forces Honor Medal First Class, Croix de Guerre and Order of the British Empire.\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States Army personnel of World War II\nUnited States Army personnel of the Vietnam War\nPeople from Somerset, Kentucky\n1918 births\n2016 deaths\nBurials at Arlington National Cemetery"},
{"id": "1386610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvid%20Gerhard%20Damm", "title": "Arvid Gerhard Damm", "text": "Arvid Gerhard Damm  (7 August 1869 – 7 November 1928) was a Swedish  engineer and inventor. He designed a number of cipher machines, and was one of the early inventors of the wired rotor principle for machine encipherment. The company, AB Cryptograph, was an early predecessor of Crypto AG.\n\nBiography\nOriginally a textile engineer, he was headmaster of a weaving school in Borås, Sweden, before moving to Finland to work as a manager of a textile factory. Although already married with a son, he fell in love with a circus performer from Hungary whose opposition to a relationship he overcame by arranging a sham civil wedding ceremony in 1900 with an officiant and two witnesses. His new “wife”, with whom he then the lived for 19 years, only became aware of the situation when Damm found a new romantic interest and wanted a divorce. After a long and acrimonious legal battle, in which he denied ever being married to her and accused her of being a spy, he was ordered to pay alimony but refused and fled to France.\n\nDamm designed a number of crypto machines, based on patents filed in Sweden, the US and many other countries. His most notable invention is that of the rotor principle, laid down in a patent application filed in Sweden on 10 October 1919, three days after Hugo Koch applied for a similar invention in the Netherlands.\n\nTo exploit his ideas, a company named AB Cryptograph was founded. Originally founded as a patent consortium, Cryptograph was established on 15 June 1915. The company itself began a year later. Cryptograph never became economically viable despite capital infusions by Emanuel Nobel, brother of Alfred Nobel. When Damm’s legal shenanigans in connection with his faked marriage became too much of an embarrassment, he was forced to give up his position in the company and moved to France where he died in 1928. In 1925, Boris Hagelin was placed in charge of the management of the company and the development of its products, having joined AB Cryptograph in 1922.\n\nDamm's first machines for Cryptograph were the 'Mecano Cryptographer Model A-1' and its interoperable portable counterpart, Model A-2, both produced in 1917. The A-1 was fitted with a keyboard. A later version (1921) could print the plaintext together with two copies of the plaintext onto tape. The machine used a chain of links, which could be reassembled by the user as part of the key. Some of the links moved a 25-disk 'key body' forward, some back.\n\nThe A-21 (1923) and the A-22 (1925) consisted of a cylinder with 26 mixed alphabet strips around it. Another strip, bearing the normal A–Z alphabet was nearby, and could take one of two positions, dependent on the movement of chain similar to the A-1. In operation, the cylinder rotated one step, as did the chain, controlling the position of the reference alphabet. To encipher or decipher (the system was set up to be reciprocal), a letter could be read off from the reference alphabet to a cylinder alphabet using a slit at the top of the machine.\n\nAchievements and legacy \n\nDamm was an ingenious inventor and quick to adapt to new possibilities. In the 1910s and early 1920s no other cryptographic inventor had patents and working machines of such complexity and diversity.\nDamm was one among the four inventors of permutation wheels (the other three being Scherbius, Koch and Hebern). He was first with a number of innovations and ideas such as\n Storing a cryptographic key as a binary sequence, first as a chain of links, later on a pinwheel\n The use of an ”Influence letter”, an autokey function \n Cryptologic checksums to prevent illegal manipulation\n Superenciphering digital codes into pronouncable letter groups. This reduced the cost of telegraphy with up to 50%\n Designing electromechanical equivalents of delay shift registers and XOR gates.\nDamm´s strength lay in his ideas and clever constructions while his mechanical designs often were unreliable. And without high reliability it was hard to find customers.\n\nDespite having no cryptographic experience, Boris Hagelin managed to use the ideas of Damm´s B-13 to develop a crypto machine, B-21, which was to compete with Enigma for sales to the Swedish General Staff. In 1928 that order was secured. Boris Hagelin also participated in the development of a machine based on A-22, called A-34. There are no records about a serial production of the A-34.\n\nInventions, production and sales \nThe following cryptomachines were designed and built, based on Damm´s inventions.\n\nPatents\nThe following patents concerning cryptography were issued to Damm in Sweden, with their United States counterparts:\n  Swedish patent SE45343, filed 1915-07-20  — 'Apparatus for Producing a Series of Signs', filed 1915-07-21.Implemented in A-1.\t\n Swedish patent SE52279 filed 19\n19-10-10, — 'Production of Ciphers', filed 1920-04-02.

{"id": "28662778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimabad", "title": "Daimabad", "text": "Daimabad is a deserted village and an archaeological site on the left bank of the Pravara River, a tributary of the Godavari River in Shrirampur taluka in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra state in India. This site was discovered by B. P. Bopardikar in 1958. It has been excavated three times so far by the Archaeological Survey of India teams. The first excavation in 1958-59 was carried out under the direction of M. N. Deshpande. The second excavation in 1974-75 was led by S. R. Rao. Finally, the excavations between 1975-76 and 1978-79 were carried out under the direction of S. A. Sali. Discoveries at Daimabad suggest that Late Harappan culture extended into the Deccan Plateau in India. Daimabad is famous for the recovery of many bronze goods, some of which were influenced by the Harappan culture.\n\nPhases of occupation\n\nThe excavations carried out in 5 m thick occupational deposit exposed evidence of five distinct Chalcolithic cultural phases, based on their characteristic painted ceramics:\n Phase I: Savalda culture (before 2300/2200 BCE)\n Phase II: Late Harappan culture (2300/2200-1800 BCE)\n Phase III: Daimabad culture (black on buff/cream ware) (1800-1600 BCE)\n Phase IV: Malwa culture (1600-1400 BCE)\n Phase V: Jorwe culture (1400-1000 BCE).\n\nThere is a break in occupation for about half-a-century between the Phase II (Late Harappan period) and Phase III (Daimabad period).\n\nPhase I: Savalda culture\nThe houses of this phase in Daimabad were of mud walls with rounded end, trilateral, of single room, two rooms and three rooms, with hearths, storage pits and jars. Sometimes there were courtyards in front and in one place, a lane has been traced. The plant remains included barley, lentil, common pea, grass pea and black gram/green gram. The excavation yielded copper-bronze rings, beads of shell, terracotta, carnelian and agate, microliths, tanged arrowheads of bone and stone mullers and querns. A phallus-shaped object made of agate was found inside a house. The ware of this phase was of medium-to-coarse fabric, made on slow wheel and treated with a thick slip showing crackles and turned light-brown, chocolate, red and pink in colour. It was mostly painted in ochre-red colour and only a few cases in black and white pigments. The burnished grey ware, the black burnished corrugated ware and the handmade thick coarse red ware with incised and applied decorations were the other ceramics found.\n\nPhase II: Late Harappan culture\nDuring this phase, the size of the settlement increased to about 20 ha. Most of the walls of the houses were destroyed by later disturbances. The walls were made of black clay with their foundations in the black soil. Large patches of finely plastered floors were found in some of the houses. The houses were arranged on either side of a 30–50cm thick wall made of black clay. A mud-brick lined grave was found within the occupational deposit, consisting of a skeleton laid out in an extended position. The body seems to have been originally covered with reeds of fibrous plants, the fibres of which were found sticking to the skeleton. The main ware was a fine red ware with linear and geometric designs painted on it in black pigment. Its shape included dishes-on-stand, bowls-on-stand, dishes and vases. The most significant discoveries from this phase were two terracotta button-shaped seals with Harappan writings and four inscribed potshreds. Other artifacts found included stone tools such as microlithic blades, beads of gold, stone and terracotta, bangles of shell and a terracotta measuring scale. The plant remains were same as Phase I, except horse gram, which made its appearance for the first time in this phase.\n\nPhase III: Daimabad culture\nThe typical pottery of this phase was a black-on-buff-and-cream ware, mainly a slow-wheel-made ceramic, fast-wheel-turned examples. It was treated on the outside with thin slip, flaked off at places, and was painted in black with chiefly geometric designs. Microlithic blades, bone tools, a single piece of worked elephant tusk, beads and a couple of fragments of graduated terracotta rings used perhaps as the measuring devices are the significant finds from this phase. Hyacinth bean was  added to the plant remains in this phase. Part of a copper-smelting furnace was found. Three burials found from this phase were of three different types, one pit burial, one post-cremation urn burial and one symbolic burial.\n\nPhase IV: Malwa culture\nA number of structural remains of this phase have been identified. Mud houses in this phase were spacious, usually rectangular, with mud-plastered floors, wooden posts embedded in the thick mud walls and steps leading up to the doorway from outside. A house with furnaces, one with a copper razor, was identified as a coppersmith's workshop. On the basis of the occurrence of fire altars, certain structures were tentatively identified as religious structures. An elaborate structural complex, which besides the residential houses or rooms closely connected with it, included a mud platform, about 18 m long, with fire altars of different shapes and an apsidal mud-wall structure, probably a temple associated with sacrificial activity were also identified. There were 16 burials in this phase, either pit or urn burials. Twigs of a fibrous plant were laid out at the bottom of the pits. The artifacts found in this phase included microlithic blades, copper objects, faience beads, terracotta and bone objects, The plant remains included barley, three types of wheat, finger millet, lentils and pulses. Sugandha bela (Pavonia odorata) probably was used for preparing perfumes. The shapes of the pottery which occurred in this phase, such as the carinated bowl, the handi-type vase with tubular spout, incurved bowl and the lota continued in the Jorwe phase.\n\nPhase V: Jorwe culture\nThe settlement increased to about 30 ha during this period. Total 25 houses were uncovered in this phase. The excavators identified the houses of a butcher, lime maker, potter, bead maker and merchant. There were five structural phases within this phase. 11 houses, two kilns and a butcher's hut were found in the first structural phase. Two houses were found in the second structural phase. Five houses were found in both the third and fourth structural phases. Two structures were found in the fifth structural phase. Traces of a mud fortification wall with bastions were discovered. The Jorwe Ware found in the lower levels of this phase, with all its characteristic types and painted designs, was deep-red in colour and had a shining surface similar to the Lustrous Red Ware. The associated wares were the burnished grey ware and the thick coarse handmade ware. The artifacts found from this phase included microliths, copper objects, beads and terracotta figurines. A cylinder seal of terracotta depicting a scene of procession through forest, a horse-drawn cart, followed by a deer looking majestically at the back and in front an animal with a long neck, probably a camel was also found. The crop remains found in this phase included almost similar to the earlier phase, with the addition of three new types of millets, kodon millet, foxtail millet and jowar. Out of the total 48 burials found in this phase, 44 were urn burials, 3 were extended pit burials and one was an extended burial in an urn.\n\nDaimabad hoard\nMost interesting discovery from the site is a hoard of four bronze objects by a Local farmer, Chhabu Laxman Bhil in 1974. He found these artifacts while digging at the base of a shrub in Daimabad village. Then he gave it to the Reputed Person of the village Lal Hussein Patel (social Worker). Lal Patel informed Archaeological survey of India later hoard was acquired by the Archaeological Survey of India and presently are in the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya in Mumbai. The Sculpture of a chariot is presently in National Museum, New Delhi.\n\nThe hoard comprises:\n a sculpture of a chariot, 45cm long and 16cm wide, yoked to two oxen, driven by a man 16cm high standing in it;\n a sculpture of a water buffalo, 31cm high and 25cm long standing on a four-legged platform attached to four solid wheels;\n a 25cm high sculpture of an elephant on a platform 27cm long and 14cm wide similar to the water buffalo sculpture, but axles and wheels missing;\n a sculpture of a rhinoceros 19cm high and 25cm long standing on two horizontal bars, each attached to an axle of two solid wheels.\n\nThe archaeologists are not unanimous about the date of these sculptures. On the basis of the circumstantial evidence, M. N. Deshpande, S. R. Rao and S. A. Sali are of view that these objects belong to the Late Harappan period. But on the basis of analysis of the elemental composition of these artifacts, D. P. Agarwal concluded that these objects may belong to the historical period. His conclusion is based on the fact these objects contain more than 10% Arsenic, while no Arsenical alloying has been found in any other Chalcolithic artifacts.\n\nSee also\n\n Indus Valley Civilization\n List of Indus Valley Civilization sites\n List of inventions and discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization\n Hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley Civilization\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n\n1958 archaeological discoveries\nVillages in Ahmednagar district\nArchaeological sites in Maharashtra"},

{"id": "10131224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oost%2C%20Limburg", "title": "Oost, Limburg", "text": "Oost is a village (and a former municipality) in the south of the Netherlands. There it is situated near the 'Maas' ('Meuse') river in the southwestern part of the province of Limburg.\n\nOost is the larger part of the merged administrative population centre of Oost-Maarland, which is part of the municipality of Eijsden-Margraten. This municipality borders with Belgium to the south and to the west. To the west that border mostly corresponds with the Meuse river. As Oost is situated in the westernmost part of this municipality, to the west its outlying area borders the Meuse river and Belgium.\n\nOost has more than 600 inhabitants and is situated  south of the city of Maastricht and 3 kilometers north of Eijsden, which is the largest place in the municipality.\n\nHistory\n\nThe region around Oost has a complex history, but significantly, many centuries ago, Oost was a seignory and its own municipality and a 'ban' (judicial district) of the Dalhem county. Since the Peace of Münster in 1648 it is part of the Northern Netherlands.\n\nIn 1828, Oost was merged with the nearby Eijsden municipality.\n\nAt the same time Maarland, the separate village a few hundred meters to the south east, that was part of another municipality also became part of Eijsden, and was joined with Oost. The name of this new 'administrative centre' became 'Oost-Maarland'.\n\nOn January 1, 2011, the Eijsden municipality merged with the neighbouring municipality of Margraten and so Oost became part of the Eijsden-Margraten municipality.\n\nName perils\nThe name 'Oost-Maarland' could lead to some confusion as 'Oost' is also the Dutch word for 'East', so it might be expected to be the eastern part of the merged village (or a place called Maarland).\nOost and Maarland are situated beside one other, but Oost (despite its name) is the western part, near the river Meuse and Maarland is the southeastern part of the community. In fact, 'Oost en Maarland' ('Oost and Maarland') would be a clearer place-name.\n\nThe origin of the name 'Oost' has surprisingly nothing to do with location. It is said to be derived from 'Augusta'. Once Saint Augusta of Treviso was the patron saint of the village, that then was called 'Augustakirchen', after the church, that then was there, dedicated to that saint. By the 18th century already the name had been deformed to 'Aoust').\n\nEconomy\n\nThe main economic activities in the village have, for generations, been (and still partially are with several working farms):\n Fruit growing (apples, pears, prunes, cherries, strawberries).\n Grain growing (wheat, barley, corn)\n Cattle farming (milk cows, hen's eggs)\n\nNaturally jobs in industry and services in nearby larger settlements have been and still are providing employment to villagers.\n\nFurthermore, since a number of farms have lost (a considerable part of) their agricultural land to several causes, such as extraction of grit in the river area and small industrial as well as housing projects, most of them have been rebuilt thus, that in former business buildings like stables now touristic apartments are rented out.\n\nCulture\nApart from a citizen soldiery, which has its own yearly events, there's other folklore in this village, like in many other villages in this region, on their separate festival days with a religious background. This festival, called the 'Bronk', starts on a Sunday in June, July or August with a procession in which the priest carries the Blessed Sacrament through the streets of the village, which for that occasion are festively decked. A typical element of these processions is the fact that on multiple stops in their route temporary altars are built, in front of which flower carpets have been laid out. When these piousnesses have ended around noon, two or three days of feasting follow. One folkloristic part of this event is the round dancing called 'Cramignon', which also takes place in the streets, whereas the involved are moving from café to café, (but not to drink coffee).\nFor a long time constantly a number of inhabitants of this village have been either musicians or board members of the military band St. Cecile, which is based in the neighbouring Eijsden and has several times ended on the first place in the highest Concert division of the World Music Contest at Kerkrade.\n\nNature\n\nTo the west and northwest of the village a considerable part of its former fruit-tree area were lost by the extraction of grit, which was abundantly present in the soil near the river. By now there's a lot of water around there, some water-recreation and some wild nature: the riverside nature reserve of 'Eijsder beemden' ('Eijsden meadows', which in fact are the 'Oost meadows').\n\nPrimarily to the north and east of the village there are still large agricultural areas with orchards, fruit plantations, grazing pastures and arable fields.\nDue to a nearby constructed highway, some business buildings and a reallocation however since the second half of the seventies the composing grounds with names as 'Oosterbroek' and 'Overbroek' have lost an considerable part of their former country charm, which also was so special as a result of their situation in the Meuse valley, with on both the east and the west side green afforested flanks of two bordering plateaux\n\n.\n\nExternal links\n Plaatsengids.nl/oost-maarland\n\nReferences\n\nFormer municipalities of Limburg (Netherlands)\nPopulated places in Limburg (Netherlands)\nEijsden-Margraten\n\nli:Oêsj-Moarend\nnl:Oost-Maarland"},

{"id": "8160262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-eight%20%28card%20game%29", "title": "Twenty-eight (card game)", "text": "Twenty-eight is an Indian trick-taking card game for four players, in which the Jack and the nine are the highest cards in every suit, followed by ace and ten. A similar game known as '29' is played in north India, both games thought to be descended from the game 304.\n\nOverview\nTwenty-eight originated in India. The game is believed to be related to the European family of Jass card games, which originated in the Netherlands. These games are believed to have been brought to India by Indian South Africans who were also influenced by the Afrikaaner game of Klaverjas.\n\nTwenty-eight is a very popular game in the state of Bihar. Some believe that the game originated in the Lakhisarai district of Bihar. The game is also very popular in South India, particularly in the state of Kerala where it is known as Irupathiyettu () or Thuruppu (). Twenty-nine is a variation of the game that is popular in North India and Bangladesh. Both games are also related to 304, a card game popular in Sri Lanka and Nepal.\n\nPlayers and cards\n28 is usually played by four players in fixed partnerships, partners facing each other. 32 cards from a standard 52-card pack are used for play. There are eight cards in each of the usual 'French' suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades. The cards in every suit rank from high to low: J-9-A-10-K-Q-8-7. The aim of the game is to win tricks containing valuable cards.\n\nThe total number of points in the deck is 28, hence the name of the game. The values of the cards are:\n\nJacks = 3 points each\nNines = 2 points each\nAces = 1 point each\nTens = 1 point each\nOther cards = (K, Q, 8, 7) no points\n\nDeal and bidding\nDeal and play are counter-clockwise; the cards are shuffled by the player who is in the left . Four cards are then dealt to each player.\n\nBased on these four cards, players bid for the right to choose trump. Each bid is a number, and the highest bidder undertakes that his or her side will win in tricks at least the number of points bid. The player to dealer's right speaks first, and must bid at least 14. Subsequent players, in counter-clockwise order, may either bid higher or pass. The auction continues once until the player passes and the bid moves on to the next player.\n\nThe highest bidder chooses a trump suit on the basis of his or her four cards, and places a card of this suit face down. The card is not shown to the other players, who therefore will not know at first what suit is trump: it remains face down in front of the bidder until at some point during the play someone calls for the trump suit to be exposed.\n\nThe dealer then completes the deal, giving four more cards to each player, so that everyone has eight.\n\nGameplay\nThe play can be divided into two phases: before and after the bidder's face down trump card (also known as 'turup') is exposed.\n\nFirst phase\nDeal and play are anti-clockwise; the cards are shuffled by the dealer and cut by the player to dealer's left. The cards are  shuffled only a few times. Four cards are then dealt to each player.\n\nBased on these four cards, players bid for the right to choose trump. Each bid is a number, and the highest bidder undertakes that his or her side will win in tricks at least the number of points bid. The player to dealer's right speaks first, and subsequent players, in anticlockwise order, may either bid higher or pass. The minimum bid allowed is 14 and the maximum is 28 (assuming that the point for the last trick is not counted; for 29, bidding starts with 17). If any player bids, the auction continues for as many rounds as necessary until three players pass in succession. The player to dealer's right must bid at least the minimum.\n\nThe final bidder chooses a trump suit and to indicate the chosen suit, places a card of the chosen suit face down on the table, and does not show this card to the other players.\n\nThe dealer then completes the deal, giving four more cards to each player, so that everyone has eight.\n\nThe player to the dealer's right leads to the first trick; players must follow suit if possible, the highest card of the suit lead wins the trick, and the winner of each trick leads to the next. During this first phase it is illegal for the bidder to lead a card of the trump suit, unless he or she has no cards of other suits or if another player has already led a card of the trump suit. If you have no card of the suit led you have two options:\n\nYou may discard any card. This card cannot win the trick.\nBefore playing a card, you may call for the bidder's face down trump to be exposed. In this case, the bidder must turn this trump card face up for all to see, and it is then added to the bidder's hand. Having called for the trump to be exposed, you must play a trump to this trick if you have one; if you have no trump you may discard any card. The play now enters the second phase.\nDuring the first phase, the face down trump card is not considered as belonging to the bidder's hand. If the bidder holds no card of the suit that was led, the bidder has essentially the same options as the other players: to discard any card without declaring trump, or to expose the face down trump card and play a trump card to the trick which was face down.\n\nDuring the first phase, cards of the (concealed) trump suit have no special effect: each trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, even if it also contains cards of the suit that is subsequently revealed as trump.\n\nSecond phase\nBeginning with the trick in which trump is exposed, each trick is won by the highest trump card in it. Tricks that contain no trump cards are won by the highest card of the suit led. Players must follow suit if possible: if unable to follow, they may play a trump card or discard a card of another suit, as they like.  As before, the winner of each trick leads to the next. The bidder is now free to lead any suit, including trump.\n\nIf a player trumps a hand and the next player does not have the suit that was played first, then either he has to over trump the hand or play other suit but cannot play a lower trump card.\n\nNote that if a situation is reached during the first phase in which the bidder has no trump cards in hand, and another player leads the trump suit, the bidder can play any card, since the face down trump card is not yet part of the bidder's hand. Of course the bidder has the option to expose the face down trump card and play it, but if the face down trump card is low and cannot win the trick, it will probably be better to save it for later. If no one calls for trump to be exposed during the first seven tricks, the game stands invalid.\n\nScoring for a round\nWhen all eight tricks have been played, each side counts the card points in the tricks it has won. The bidding team needs at least as many card points as the bid to win; otherwise they lose, adjusted for a declaration of a Pair if appropriate, they win one game point; otherwise they lose one game point. The score of the team playing against the bidder does not change.\n\nEach side keeps score using a red Six (known as nali or red chaka) and a black Six (known as kala or black chaka), from the cards not used in the game. These are arranged to display either a number of red pips, representing a positive score, or a number of black pips, for a negative score. At the start of the game no pips are showing. If the bidding side wins, they expose one extra red pip or (if they had black pips showing) cover one black pip; if they lose they expose a black pip or cover a red pip.\n\nMany play that if the bidder scores less than half of the call this doubles the number of game points they lose.\nThe player has no rights to shuffle the card on the first round of the bid. Shuffling card means losing the game, he may only cut once without touching the pack.\nIf the player calls half-court, only three rather than the customary six cards are played. If the caller wins all three rounds, the other player forfeits two cards\nhh;;\n\nKeeping team score\nSome play that after the bidder has chosen trump or asked for the 'seventh card', but before the dealer continues the deal, either opponent of the bidder may say 'double' if he or she believes that the bidder's team will fail. The bidder's team will then win two game points rather than one if they succeed and lose two game points if they fail.\n\nSome play that after a double, the bidder or the bidder's partner can reply with a 'redouble', which doubles the score again to four game points won or lost.\n\nSome give the whole pile of unused cards (2s to 5s of all suits) to the trump maker, who arranges them with a card on the bottom to indicate the trump suit - or the seventh card is placed under them if 'seventh card' was called. A double or redouble is indicated by flipping face up one or two cards respectively from the top of this pile. The identity of the flipped card has no effect on the game - it is just there to remind the players that the game has been doubled.\n\nOne variation exists in which the score for the game is increased to two game points whenever the bid is 21 or more. The bidding side exposes or covers two red or black pips rather than just one.\n\nIn this version, bids of 20 or less can be doubled by the opponents and redoubled by the bidding team as described above. Bids of 21 or more, which are already worth two game points, can be doubled by the bidder's opponents, raising their value to four points (this is treated as a redouble), but four game points are the limit: the value cannot be further increased by the bidding team. However this rule is implemented to speed up the game and to make it more enjoyable, but this rule is not a compulsion.\n\nAlso in some parts of India, especially in  Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand they also play in which you can bid six points in a single game. It's called a 'C', but this can only be implemented by the bidder if there is not a single pip displayed either black or red and the opponent has given a double. If you are playing an auto-double game version then also a 'C' cannot be implemented.\n\nThe game is won by the first team to reach a cumulative score of plus 6 game points, shown by six red pips for all the numbers 2-6. Each win or loss of six pips opens up a set. A red set if won and black if lost. It is best practice to drop a set if both team has same set open. It also ends if a team reaches minus 6 game points (six black pips) for all the numbers 2-6, thereby losing the game.\n\nIn Kerala this game is popularly known as Lelam.\n\nMiscellaneous rules\nThe game is cancelled if any of the following events occur:\nIf first hand for the first player who was dealt doesn’t have a point, card can be reshuffle \n If any player is dealt 8 cards that are worth 0 points.\n if any player makes a mistake during the game, he forfeits the points he called in the start or the opposite player gains the points which they made at the start.\n If any player has all the four Jack cards.\n If any player has all cards of the same suit\n If the person next to the shuffler has point-less cards. Here's a catch if he chooses not to bid and the person next to him has again pointless cards then the game has to be cancelled.\n Many think that the maximum point that can be played for is 28 or 29. But actually it is 32 and 33. Pair can be shown and points reduced to 28 or 29 as the case may be.\n\nPair rule\nThe pair rule increases or decreases the bid value by 4 points.  Pair should be shown only when the trump card has been revealed and either party (bidder and opposition) takes a hand after the trump card has been shown, but you must take the hand using trump card before showing trump, i.e. you cannot show the pair and then take a hand with queen or king but rather you should take a hand with a different card and then show the pair. If the opposing team has the pair, then the bid value increases by 4 points. In some variations people also go for doubling or halving of the points depending on which person has the king/queen pair.\n\nIn West Bengal, a variant of 28 is played where the lowest score is 16 and maximum is 28. In this variation, for a bid of 16-18 points, the bidding team cannot show the pair. They must have bid at least 19 to show it. But if the bidding point is 19 the bid value will decrease by 3 points only and above it (20-28) the bid value will decrease by 4 points.\n\nSingle Hand\nSome play that after all the cards have been dealt, but before the lead to the first trick, a player with very strong cards may declare a 'single hand', undertaking to win all eight tricks, playing alone. In this case there is no trump, the player who announced 'single hand' leads to the first trick, and the partner of the lone player places his or her hand face down and takes no part in the play. The lone player's team wins 3 game points if all eight tricks are won, and loses 3 points otherwise. 'Single hand' cannot be declared with a hand that is certain to win eight tricks - the player must have at least one card that could lose a trick in any possible way.\nIf multiple players want to play 'Single Hand', the first player to declare 'single hand' will play 'Single Hand'.\n\nIf the bidder is with Single Hand Show will drop all cards undertaking to win all eight tricks. Moreover, there is catch where all the cards are from same suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades, Its a 'Single Hand Show' game wins 3 game points.\n\nVariants\n\nTwenty Nine\n29 is the most popular variant of twenty-eight. In this game, the winner of the last round gets an extra point hence the name. 29 is one of the most popular card games in the South Asia (especially in Bangladesh). The bidding starts from 16. You can show the pair of king and queen of the same colour of the trump, by doing this bidding is increased or decreased by 4 points depending on which team has shown the pair that is defender or bidding team. A variation popular among Indian South Africans is called Thunee (various spellings).\n\nForty\n40 is another variation of these set of games, usually played in India. The game requires 6 players. In this game, cards '3' of each suite is added. These '3's carry the value of jacks, i.e., 3 points. Both 3 and Jack has the same value. The first player to play any of these will win the round, if every other rules are followed. Twenty is the minimum call, the bidder has to make. The point system is as follows.\n 20 to 29 - If the bidding team wins, they get 1 point and if they lose the opponents get 2 points.\n 30-33 - If the bidding team wins, they get 2 point and if they lose the opponents get 3 points. \n 34-40 - If the bidding team wins, they get 3 point and if they lose the opponents get 4 points. \n Thani/Single - If the bidding team wins, they get 4 point and if they lose the opponents get 5 points. \nIf any player wants to bid for a second time, he/she will have to bid for 30 or more. Another rule forbids the player next to the shuffler (the first bidder) to bid, if he/she has the cards of one suite only. If, however, a wrong game is played and the opponents find it out, the opponents will receive double the point which were due to them, if otherwise.\n\nFifty-Six \nPopular in the Indian province of Kerala, 56 (or Ambathiyaaru) doubles the number of total points to be won, and is played with a double pack. It is usually played as a 6 player game, although variations of 4 and 8 players are possible.\n\nOther rules\n\nSome play that opponent can show the pair anytime after the trump is revealed and that bidder can show pair after the trump is revealed if they have taken hand before the trump was revealed.\n\nAnother variant is that Jacks can be passed at any time, by anybody.\n\nSome play that auto-double is allowed at 20, 21, 22 and so on, and that C can be played for 6 points if the point is 0 for the bidding team and opposition has given double or worse if it is an auto-double.\n\nReferences\n\nIndian card games\nJack-Nine games\nYear of introduction missing"},

He was the first Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Australia.\n\nEarly life\nDonaldson was the third son of Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson and his wife Amelia née Cowper and was born in London, England. He was educated at Eton, where he rowed in the eight, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He narrowly missed representing Cambridge in the 1883 boat race, when having been selected stroke of the crew he fell ill and was forbidden to row by the doctors. He graduated B.A. in 1885 with a first class degree in classics and obtained a first class in theology in 1887.\n\nCareer\nDonaldson was ordained deacon in 1888 and priest in 1889. After a short while as a curate at Bethnal Green he was a domestic chaplain to archbishop Benson from 1888 to 1891. In 1891 Donaldson became vicar of St Mary's, Hackney Wick, and was head of the Eton Mission until 1900. He was in November 1901 appointed Rector of Hornsey, and in October the following year also as Rural Dean of Hornsey, serving from 1902 to 1904. At only 41 years of age he was chosen to be Bishop of Brisbane, was consecrated on 28 October 1904, and arrived at Brisbane on 19 December 1904. On St Thomas Day, 21 December 1904, he was enthroned as Bishop of Brisbane in St Luke's Church of England in Charlotte Street, Brisbane, as the diocese's cathedral had not yet been completed.\n\nWhen Donaldson began his episcopate he found that over £30,000 was on hand for the building of St John's Cathedral. He immediately set to work to raise the remaining necessary funds, and six years later the cathedral was consecrated. In 1905 the five dioceses in Queensland and New Guinea were formed into a province, and Donaldson became Archbishop of Brisbane. He interested himself especially in the development of the theological college, in religions instruction in schools, and in the founding of church schools. He gave much time and thought to the diocesan war memorial, which eventually took the form of St Martin's Hospital near the cathedral. About £100,000 was raised for this including a gift of £1000 from Donaldson himself. Donalson gave attention to moral causes of industrial unrest and the 'inward spiritual significance of the Labour movement', and he offered to mediate in the 1912 Brisbane general strike. Donaldson spoke strongly on the question of justice to the aborigines, urging that a large tract of land should be handed to them which whites should not be allowed to occupy. During his episcopate of 17 years the number of clergy increased from 55 to well over 100.\n\nIn 1921 he was appointed Bishop of Salisbury, and on his return to England was pronounced by Arthur Benson to be 'a very fine, simple-minded, robust, sensible prelate'. At Salisbury as at Brisbane he became the trusted friend of his clergy and no parish was too isolated to be visited. He did work in convocation and was for many years chairman of the board of missions.\n\nLate life\nDonaldson had a difficult task as chairman of the joint committee of the Canterbury convocation on 'The Church and Marriage', which sat from 1931 until 1935. In 1933 he was appointed by the King Prelate of the Order of St Michael and St George. He held the honorary degrees of D.D. of Oxford and Cambridge, and D.C.L. Durham. After leaving Australia he retained his interest in his old diocese and continued to make monetary contributions to its needs. In his will £4000 was left to endowment funds of the Brisbane diocese. He died suddenly at Salisbury on 7 December 1935 aged 72. He was unmarried.\n\nReferences\n\nBetty Crouchley, 'Donaldson, St Clair George Alfred (1863 - 1935)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol.8, MUP, 1981, pp 319–320.\n\nExternal links\nDonaldson at ThePeerage\n\n1863 births\n1935 deaths\nPeople educated at Eton College\nAnglican archbishops of Brisbane\n20th-century Church of England bishops\n20th-century Anglican archbishops\n20th-century Anglican bishops in Australia"},
{"id": "62163427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechococcus%20elongatus", "title": "Synechococcus elongatus", "text": "Synechococcus elongatus is a unicellular cyanobacterium that has a rapid autotrophic growth comparable to yeast. Its ability to grow rapidly using sunlight has implications for biotechnological applications, especially when incorporating genetic modification.\n\nOccurrence \nIn the last decade, several strains of Synechococcus elongatus have been produced in laboratory environments, which ultimately led to the production of Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973. S. elongatus UTEX 2973 is a mutant hybrid from UTEX 625.\n\nIn 1955, William A. Kratz and Jack Myers described a fast-growing cyanobacterial strain, Anacystis nidulans which was deposited in the University of Texas algae culture collection as Synechococcus leopoliensis UTEX 625 However, that strain had lost its rapid growth property and was also unable to grow at high temperatures, unlike the original strain. In 2015, Jingjie Yu and colleagues, were able to isolate the mutant strain from a mixed culture of Synechococcus UTEX 625. The mutant strain was deposited to the UTEX algae culture collection, and given a new number, UTEX 2979.\n\nStructure \nSynechococcus elongatus is rod-shaped with its cells typically greater than 2 micrometers in length. It typically contains 2–3 thylakoid membrane layers forming evenly spaced concentric rings and its carboxysomes and polyphosphate bodies are located in the central cytoplasmic region (Image 1).\n\nGenetics \nThe genome sequence of Synechococcus UTEX 2973 was similar to the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7942. Even though it was isolated from S. elongatus 625, it is most closely related to S. elongatus PCC 7942 with 99.8% similarity. S. elongatus UTEX 2973 contains a SNP to the gene encoding ATP synthase F1 subunit α, comparable to the corresponding gene in Synechococcus PCC 7942. This specific SNP causes an amino acid substitution at the 252nd position of the protein.\n\nMetabolism \nSynechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 is photoautotrophic and has one of the shortest doubling times reported for cyanobacteria at 1.5 hours in a BG11 medium at 42°C under continuous 1,500 μmoles photons·m−2·s−1 white light with 5% CO2. While it is typically maintained on BG11 media, it can also be cryopreserved using 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cryoprotectant.\n\nSignificance \nUngerer and colleagues, 2018, used CRISPR/Cpf1, to perform a mutational analysis of S. elongatus UTEX 2973 by identifying the three genes with SNPs associated with rapid growth, atpA, ppnK, and rpaA. They replaced these fast-growth alleles with the wild-type alleles in the broadly studied cyanobacterium, Synechococcus 7942. This resulted in Synechococcus 7942 reduction in doubling time from 6.8 to 2.3 hours\n\nReferences \n\nSynechococcales"},

{"id": "61729242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan%20Gerson", "title": "Juan Gerson", "text": "Juan Gerson (active c. 1562) was a high status indigenous Nahua painter, named after the French theologian Jean Gerson, working in Tecamachalco, Puebla.  Not until 1962 when a group of Mexican scholars found documentation to his high status indigenous heritage was Gerson identity revealed.  It was previously thought he was Flemish, trained in Italy, working from entirely within the European tradition before coming to colonial Mexico.  Art historians Carolyn Dean and Dana Leibsohn consider Gerson's case of misrecognition as 'reveal[ing] once again our refusal to recognize the indigene unless his or her work is visibly pre-Hispanic. Further, the revisions of scholarship that follow the discovery of these artists' genetic make-up involve a literal re-seeing of their work.' Mexican art historian Francisco Pérez Salazar considers his work 'mediocre and defective.'\n\nHis paintings decorated chapels in sixteenth-century central Mexico. He is known to have painted the church of St Francisco de Tecamachalco. Manuel Toussaint attributes murals to him in Epazoyucan, based on style.  He painted scenes of the Old Testament and the Apocalypse in bright colors on amate paper, then applied to the walls, rather than painted on them directly.  Likely he used European printed woodcuts available in New Spain by this time as models.  The 28 scenes in Tecamachaldo start with Cain and Abel, the Flood, the Tower of Babel, Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac, the Dream of Jacob, and Ezekiel's “visions of the Heavenly Jerusalem and the Altar of the Holocaust.”  'Some scholars believe that he chose the Apocalypse as a subject because it resonated with pre-Hispanic traditions.'  It is speculated that Gerson was the illustrator for the Voynich Codex.\n\nSee also\nMexican art\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nAbrego, María Elena Landa. Juan Gerson, tlacuilo.

{"id": "248608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rie%20Tanaka", "title": "Rie Tanaka", "text": "is a Japanese voice actress and singer who is currently affiliated with Office Anemone. Notable among her numerous roles in anime are Lacus Clyne in Mobile Suit Gundam Seed and Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny, Chi in Chobits, Hikari Kujou/Shiny Luminous in Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart, Minna-Dietlinde Wilcke in Strike Witches and Suigintou in the anime adaptation of Rozen Maiden. In video games, she provides the voice of title character Neptune in the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise, Morrigan Aensland in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Project X Zone, Sesshoin Kiara in Fate/Extra and Fate/Grand Order, Murata Himeko in Honkai Impact 3rd, Mitsuru Kirijo in Persona 3, Lisa in Genshin Impact and Ciel in Megaman Zero.\n\nBiography\nWhen Tanaka was in elementary school, she was a member of the book club. She loved to read to others, and would give picture story shows to the younger students in the morning before the homeroom teacher came to the classroom. One of the activities of the book committee was to hold a picture-story show competition in the audio-visual room, and when the students saw her picture-story show, they were delighted. She loved reading and illustrations to begin with, especially those of Mutsumi Inomata, and her desire to become a voice actress was directly triggered when she bought and listened to the drama CD CD Theater Dragon Quest, whose jacket illustration was done by Inomata, at a bookstore.\n\nWhen she was in high school, she was a member of the Manga Research Club and participated in the Manga Nationals, where she directly appealed to Kazuhiko Shimamoto, a judge from her hometown, that she wanted to be a voice actor. After graduating from high school, she moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the voice acting course at Yoyogi Animation Academy. As she was very fond of reading and taking care of children, becoming a nursery teacher was also a big dream of hers. She was torn between going on to higher education and becoming a nursery teacher or becoming a voice actor, but she chose the latter because she wanted to bring her voice to children in a larger world, not stopping at one world. While still in school, Tanaka won the grand prize at the vocal audition held by MediaWorks & Scitron Digital Contents. She made her debut in the entertainment industry when she sang the opening theme song for the PlayStation version of 'Eien no Shin'yū' in Yūkyū Gensōkyoku 2nd Album. This is why her debut as a singer was earlier than her debut as a voice actor. At the same time, she also participated in the theatrical anime Rurouni Kenshin: The Motion Picture as a minor role. She made her debut as an agency voice actress in 1999, playing the role of Mitsuki Sanada, one of the heroines in Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure. 2006 saw her first starring role as Hiroko Matsukata in Hataraki Man.\n\nDue to management reasons, Tanaka moved from Dramatic Department, to which she had belonged for many years, to Retreat on April 1, 2008, and to Office Anemone on March 1, 2019.\n\nIn addition to voice acting, Tanaka is also active in music, singing character songs for some works, and sometimes releasing singles under her own name. On April 26, 2019, it was announced that she will be working as a Youtuber under the show name 'Rie Tanaka TV.'\n\nPersonal life\nTanaka's favorite phrase is 'Never get discouraged, never run away, never give up,' and she has been actively increasing her Twitter friends since around 2010, including Rina Satō and Kenjiro Hata. However, on June 23, 2013, a man with a knife intruded a Neptunia promotion where Tanaka was present, yelling 'Give me Tanaka! I am the victim!'. In the hustle, Tanaka fell and bruised her knee, and after the incident, she took a break from Twitter and later returned in 2014.\n\nOn June 17, 2012, Tanaka announced on her blog that she had married voice actor Kōichi Yamadera. A year later, she disbanded her official fan club, 'Cafe de Rie.' She co-starred with Yamadera as Kusuo's maternal parents in 2016's The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.. On August 3, 2018, she announced on Twitter that she and Yamadera had divorced in July.\n\nFilmography\n\nAnime\n\nFilm\n\nVideo games\n\nTokusatsu\n\nDrama CDs\n\nDubbing\n\nDiscography\n\nSongs anime/video games\n Azumanga Daioh\n Oishii Kimitachi (Yomi's image song)\n Sorezore no One Way (Yomi's second image song)\n Bakuretsu Tenshi – Breathe (Sei's image song)\n Chobits\n Raison d'être (ED1) (Reason To Be)\n Ningyo hime (ED2) (Doll/Mermaid Princess)\n I Hear You Everywhere (Chi image song)\n Hitomi no Tonneru\n Shiranai Sora\n Dual!

The bandmembers were drummer Slim Jim Phantom, bassist Lee Rocker, and guitarist Earl Slick. Phantom and Rocker had previously played together as members of the Stray Cats. They released two albums, Phantom, Rocker & Slick and Cover Girl, on EMI Records before disbanding.\n\nHistory\n Slim Jim Phantom and Lee Rocker grew up together in New York City. They began writing songs when they were 12 years old. Along with Brian Setzer, they formed the Stray Cats. When the Stray Cats broke up, they began looking for a new guitarist and met sessionman Earl Slick at a music trade show, leading to the formation of the band. Years earlier, Rocker had been a fan of Slick's guitar work on David Bowie's David Live. Slick also played on Bowie's Station to Station and John Lennon's Double Fantasy.\nTheir first release, 1985's self-titled Phantom, Rocker & Slick, was produced by Michael Barbiero & Steve Thompson and was a moderate success, peaking at 62 on the Billboard 200. Its first single was 'Men Without Shame' and was written in ten minutes. It did well on the Top Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number 7. It was played in the active rotation on MTV. The single 'My Mistake' also appeared on the Top Rock Tracks chart, peaking at 33, and featured Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones on guitar.  Nicky Hopkins also made a guest appearance on the album, playing piano on the track 'No Regrets'.\n\nThe release of their second album, Cover Girl in 1986, was the beginning of the end for the band.

The monument was opened in 1982, on the 20th anniversary of Algeria's independence. It is fashioned in the shape of three standing palm leaves, which shelter the 'Eternal Flame' under it. At the edge of each palm leaf is a statue of a soldier representing a stage of Algeria's struggle for independence.\n\nLocation\nThe Martyrs Memorial is located on the heights of Algiers, in the municipality of El Madania, west of the Bois des arcades, east of Diar el Mahçoul and north of the plaza shopping center Riadh El Feth. It overlooks the neighborhood of Hamma (common Belouizdad) and Botanical Garden Hamma (known as Jardin d'essai) in the north. The monument has been erected on the site of an ancient military fort.\n\nDescription\n\nConsisting of three stylized fins that join mid-height, the concrete monument built by the Canadian company Lavalin, based on a model produced in the Fine Art Institute of Algiers, under the leadership of Bashir Yelles, reaches a height of . Above the three supporting fins, at  from the ground, is an Islamic style turret with a diameter of  and a height of , topped by a dome of . It rests on an esplanade that burns an 'eternal flame' and includes a crypt, an amphitheater and the National Museum of El Mujahid (underground).\n\nConstruction\n\nThe project to build a memorial in memory of the dead from the War of Independence is the brainchild of President Houari Boumedienne. Its implementation was, however, completed under the presidency of his successor Chadli Bendjedid.\n\nThe company Lavalin is responsible of the studies and construction of the monument. Several Algerian artists involved, like the painter Bashir Yelles, the calligrapher Abdelhamid Skander and the Polish sculptor Marian Konieczny.\n\nThe completion of the work was a real technological challenge because of the constraints inherent to the geometry of the assembly, especially the curvature of the fins, the situation of the site at the edge of a steep cliff and high seismicity of the region. Pierre Lamarre, director of engineering and structural design, Claude Naud, expert planning and construction methods, along with Bashir Yelles, imagined a solution that proved itself decisive and innovative.\n\nSeven months (7 months and 20 day) (November 15, 1981 to July 5, 1982) were necessary to build this architectural work. The monument was inaugurated by the then President Chadli Bendjedid in February 1986.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n Algerian war\n Azadi Tower\n Pearl square\n Memorial to the Liberation of Algeria\n\nNotes\n\nBuildings and structures in Algiers\n1982 sculptures\nMartyrs' monuments and memorials\nTowers completed in 1982\nNational monuments in Algeria\nTourist attractions in Algiers\n1982 establishments in Algeria"},

It operates the KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft conducting air refueling missions.\n\nThe squadron was first activated in 1942 as the 19th Reconnaissance Squadron, but was redesignated the 409th Bombardment Squadron shortly after activation.  After briefly serving as an antisubmarine unit, it participated in combat in the Mediterranean and European Theaters of Operations, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations for its actions.  After the surrender of Germany the squadron returned to the United States and was inactivated.\n\nThe squadron was reactivated shortly after the end of World War II as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit, and became one of the first units of Strategic Air Command in 1946.  It was inactivated later that year when its parent group was replaced by the 43d Bombardment Group.\n\nThe 909th Air Refueling Squadron was activated in 1963 at Amarillo Air Force Base, Texas.   The squadron supported Strategic Air Command operations from activation and, starting in 1964, supported operations in Southeast Asia from Amarillo, March Air Force Base, California and Kadena Air Base, Okinawa.  After the end of the Vietnam War, the squadron continued to support refueling and reconnaissance operations in the Pacific.  In 1985 the 409th and 909th squadrons were consolidated into a single unit.  The squadron also provided support for combat operations in Southwest Asia during the 1990s.\n\nMission\nThe 909th is the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)'s 'lead force' for air refueling U.S. and allied aircraft during contingencies. The squadron accomplishes aeromedical evacuations for military and civilian members, transporting patients to as far away as the United States when necessary.  It also conducts Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and headquarters- and command-directed missions.\n\nHistory\n\nWorld War II\n\nTraining and initial operations\nThe squadron was established as the 19th Reconnaissance Squadron in early 1942 at Barksdale Field, Louisiana as one of the original four squadrons of the 93d Bombardment Group. The squadron was formed from a cadre supplied by the 44th Bombardment Group and was equipped with Consolidated B-24D Liberators. Shortly after activation the 19th was redesignated as the 409th Bombardment Squadron. It completed its Phase I training at Barksdale. The squadron moved to Page Field, Florida, and flew antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea until the end of July. Its parent group claimed the destruction of three U-boats while stationed in Florida.\n\nTwo weeks later the squadron began to deploy to the European Theater of Operations. Its ground echelon sailed aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth on 31 August, arriving in Scotland on 1 September.  The air echelon transferred to Grenier Field, New Hampshire, where it received new B-24Ds.  It flew the first formation crossing of the Atlantic in September.\n\nThe squadron was a member of the first B-24 heavy bomber group to become part of VIII Bomber Command in England. It flew its first mission on 9 October against a steel factory at Lille.  Until December, it operated primarily against submarine pens on the coast of the Bay of Biscay.  The squadron flew some antisubmarine patrols with RAF Coastal Command from RAF Holmsley South. Later in the month the 409th transferred some of its personnel to the 329th Bombardment Squadron, which was training for special operations.\n\nDeployments to the Mediterranean Theater\nIn early December, the air echelon of the squadron deployed to Algeria, where it was attached to XII Bomber Command. Operating with inadequate supplies under difficult conditions the squadron struck heavy blows against enemy shipping and lines of communication during its Mediterranean deployment.  Tafaraoui Airfield had no hardened runways, and the first four missions had to be cancelled when heavy rains turned the airfield into a sea of mud, making it impossible to taxi.  After flying one mission, the unit moved to Gambut Main, Libya, where it came under the control of IX Bomber Command.  At Gambut, dust storms 'played havoc' with the engines of the squadron's B-24s.  The 409th flew 22 missions, attacking enemy ports and attacking Italian supply centers to support the British Eighth Army. The squadron was awarded its first Distinguished Unit Citation for these efforts.\n\nThe squadron returned to England in February 1943 and until June attacked engine repair facilities, power plants, harbors, and other targets in France, the Low Countries and Germany.  In May the squadron was withdrawn from operations and began to train for night attacks.  However, this training ended abruptly and the squadrons of the 93d group joined those of the only other B-24 group in Eighth Air Force, the 44th Bombardment Group, in flying diversionary missions, while Eighth's Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses attacked primary targets.  On 29 May the squadron was once again taken off operations and began practicing low level flights over England. Norden bombsights were removed from unit B-24s and a modified gunsight, optimized for low level attacks, replaced them. Liberators that had been modified for night operations were sent to another unit and bomb bay tanks were installed in others.\n\nIn June, the air echelon returned to Libya and initially supported Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, flying ten missions. Following this, the unit resumed low level training in Libya.  On 1 August, the squadron participated in Operation Tidal Wave, the low level attack on oil refineries near Ploiești, where 60% of the Axis fuel was produced. This attack involved a round trip of over 2,000 miles. The squadron's formation followed the 376th Bombardment Group which had mistaken the Initial Point for the bomb run and flew the wrong course to the target, bombing targets that had been assigned to other groups, despite heavy opposition from enemy forces that had been fully alerted to the approach of the bombers. For this action, the squadron earned its second Distinguished Unit Citation. Before departing the Mediterranean, the squadron flew an attack against the Messerschmitt Bf 109 factory at Wiener Neustadt, stretching the range of its B-24s and requiring it to recover at bases in Tunisia, which were closer than its station in Libya.\n\nThe squadron returned to England in August, but flew only two missions before the air echelon returned to the Mediterranean to fly missions from Tunisia to support the Fifth Army at Salerno during Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy. The crews and aircraft returned to England in October.\n\nEuropean Theater and post war\n\nFrom England, the squadron resumed strategic bombardment raids against marshalling yards, aircraft factories, chemical plants, and oil refineries in Germany.  The squadron also made tactical attacks on gun emplacements near Cherbourg during Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion, in June 1944 and attacked troop concentrations during the Saint Lo breakout the following month.  In August and September, its bombers were diverted to airlifting food, gasoline, water and other supplies to Allies advancing through northern France.  It also dropped supplies to airborne troops engaged in Operation Market Garden airborne attacks in the Netherlands.\n\nNear the end of the war, on 24 March 1945, the squadron dropped supplies to airborne forces near Wesel and bombed a night fighter base near Störmede during Operation Varsity, the airborne assault across the Rhine.  The squadron ended combat operations in April, and began returning to the United States in May and June. The ground echelon sailed aboard the RMS Queen Mary and received thirty days leave upon arrival. In July the 409th was inactivated when its parent group began conversion to Boeing B-29 Superfortresses.\n\nThe squadron was activated again at Pratt Army Air Field, Kansas in August where it began to train with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. At the end of the year the squadron moved to Clovis Army Air Field, New Mexico.\nIn the spring of 1946 the squadron became one of the first units assigned to the new Strategic Air Command, and in June it moved to Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, where it was assigned to the 444th Bombardment Group.  In October, the 444th group and its squadrons were inactivated and their mission, equipment and personnel were transferred to the 43d Bombardment Group.\n\nAir refueling operations\nThe 909th Air Refueling Squadron was organized at Amarillo Air Force Base, Texas in Apr 1963. Once the squadron was combat ready in July, half of the squadron's aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled and ready for combat to reduce vulnerability to a Soviet missile strike. The squadron trained with Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and conducted worldwide air refueling and participated in Strategic Air Command (SAC) directed exercises.  The 909th deployed to refuel tactical units in Southeast Asia as part of Operation Young Tiger and deployed crews and planes to Spain and Alaska for support of Operation Chrome Dome airborne alert forces. The squadron also supported Operation Arc Light B-52 strikes in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe 909th maintained combat proficiency at Amarillo until June 1966, when it moved to March Air Force Base, California, where it was assigned to the 22d Bombardment Wing, which became a 'super wing' with two bombardment squadrons and two air refueling squadrons assigned. From May to October 1967 the squadron was non-operational as the 22d wing was reduced to a small rear echelon non-combat organization with all its tactical resources allotted to SAC organizations involved in combat in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe unit rotated aircrews to Southeast Asia from 1967 to 1973.  In 1971 SAC decided to maintain a permanent tanker presence in the Pacific and the squadron moved to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. The squadron supported the tanker task force at Kadena (Giant Bear) and reconnaissance operations (Rivet Joint and Cobra Ball). In 1991, the squadron was transferred to Pacific Air Forces and reassigned from the 376th Strategic Wing to the 18th Operations Group.\n\nThe 909th provided air refueling in Southwest Asia during Operation Desert Storm from August 1990 to March 1991. In 1996 it revisited Southwest Asia to support Operation Desert Strike, an attack against fixed surface-to-air missile sites and air defense sites in Iraq.\n\nExpeditionary operations\nThe 909th has been a major force provider for a number of operations in the Pacific area.  For these operations, PACAF has activated a provisional 909th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron for the operations, using the squadron's resources.  The 909th expeditionary squadron has been:\n Assigned to the 613th Air Expeditionary Group from 1 January 2000 to 31 January 2000 at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base for Cope Tiger\n Assigned to the 13th Air Expeditionary Group from 5 February 2004 to 9 March 2004 at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base for Cope Tiger 04\n Assigned to the 605th Air Expeditionary Group from 30 October 2004 to 30 November 2004 at Yokota Air Base for Keen Sword 05\n Assigned to the 3d Air Expeditionary Group from 2 October 2005 to 24 October 2005 at Eielson Air Force Base for Cope Thunder 06-1\n Assigned to the 5th Air Expeditionary Group from 31 October 2005 to 24 November 2005 at Yokota Air Base for Cope North 06-1\n Assigned to the 13th Air Expeditionary Group from 14 January 2008 to 13 February 2008 at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base for Cope Tiger 08\n Attached to Thirteenth Air Force from 21 November 2008 to 9 December 2008 at RAAF Base Darwin for Aces North 09\n Assigned to the 13th Air Expeditionary Wing from c.

{"id": "712938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%20Time%20for%20Choosing", "title": "A Time for Choosing", "text": "'A Time for Choosing', also known as 'The Speech', was a speech presented during the 1964 U.S. presidential election campaign by future president Ronald Reagan on behalf of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. The speech launched Reagan into national prominence in politics.\n\nBackground\nMany versions of the speech exist, since it was altered over many weeks.  Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for presidential candidate Senator Barry Goldwater; Everett Dirksen gave that nomination speech, while Richard Nixon introduced Goldwater prior to his acceptance speech.  Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use 'A Time for Choosing' until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, Rendezvous with Destiny. (The title of the program was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt in his June 27, 1936 speech to the 1936 Democratic National Convention.) In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan recalled going to bed that night 'hoping I hadn't let Barry down.'\n\nSpeaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In the speech, he revealed his ideological motivation: 'The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.' He also said, 'You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with law and order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.' The speech raised $1 million for Goldwater's campaign, and is considered the event that launched Reagan's political career.\n\nAftermath\n'A Time For Choosing' has been considered one of the most effective speeches ever made by an eventual presidential candidate. Nevertheless, Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Soon afterwards, Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California; he ran for office and won election in 1966. Reagan was later dubbed the 'Great Communicator' in recognition of his effective oratory skills.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Bimes, Terri. 'Ronald Reagan and the New Conservative Populism.'

It is loosely based on the animated series of the same name. In Japan, Data East released it as a non-Ghostbusters arcade game under the title  In 1989, Activision published The Real Ghostbusters for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nGameplay\nThe Real Ghostbusters is a shoot 'em up game loosely based on the animated series of the same name. It features 10 levels, each viewed from an angled overhead perspective. The player controls a member of the Ghostbusters team who must defend against various monsters and ghosts while completing each level on a time limit. Monsters are killed if the player shoots at them, and the player can earn bonus points by trapping each monster's soul, which is done by using a proton beam to suck in the ghost.\n\nBonus items that can aid the player are hidden throughout the game in objects such as oil drums and wheelbarrows. Bonus items include weapon upgrades, or a Slimer ghost who protects the player by killing enemies who get too close. The end of each level features a boss enemy ghost who must be defeated, leaving behind a key that allows the player to access the next level. The arcade version includes a multiplayer option for up to three players, while the computer versions feature only a two-player option for multiplayer mode.\n\nMeikyuu Hunter G features eight levels, similar to The Real Ghostbusters but with different layouts. It features less weaponry than The Real Ghostbusters and the multiplayer mode supports only two players instead of three.\n\nDevelopment and release\nData East developed Meikyuu Hunter G as a non-Ghostbusters arcade game and released it in Japan in 1987. The arcade game was released in the United States during the same year as The Real Ghostbusters. The U.S. version features some modifications from the Japanese version. Most of the enemies were redrawn for the Real Ghostbusters version, which also features Ray Parker Jr.'s song 'Ghostbusters.' A small number of Real Ghostbusters arcade units were shipped to the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1989, Activision published conversions of The Real Ghostbusters for various computer platforms in Europe, including Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 (C64), and ZX Spectrum. In the United Kingdom in 1991, The Hit Squad published The Real Ghostbusters as a budget re-release for CPC and C64.\n\nReception\n\nChris Jenkins of ACE called the arcade version 'enormous fun' and believed it would become a hit, while John Cook of Computer and Video Games (CVG) later wrote that the arcade version 'didn't do astonishingly well'. Cook considered the arcade version and its computer conversions to be mediocre, and believed that the game would primarily appeal to Ghostbusters fans and 'undemanding gamers'. Some reviewers criticized the computer versions for their graphics, character sprites, and scrolling. Critics had differing opinions as to whether The Real Ghostbusters was a superior game to Activision's original Ghostbusters game.\n\nAndy Smith of ACE reviewed the Atari ST and ZX Spectrum versions and considered them to be an accurate reproduction of the arcade game, but he criticized the graphics, the collision detection, the gameplay, and the 'confusing' perspective. Zzap!64 criticized the graphics and sound of the C64 and Amiga versions, while also criticizing the latter version for poor collision detection. The Games Machine considered the color scheme of the Amstrad CPC version unattractive, and stated that the Atari ST version was as 'unimpressive' as the Amiga version. The ST version was criticized for its animation, 'crude' music and sound, and jerky movements, with the conclusion that it would only appeal to Real Ghostbusters fans.\n\nMark Patterson of CU Commodore User Amiga-64 considered the playable character to be 'tiny, blocky, and poorly animated', and considered the character movements difficult to perform due to the game's perspective. Reviewers for Crash called the game 'addictive and highly enjoyable,' praising the graphics, music, and gameplay, although one reviewer criticized the two-player mode for issues involving the controls and scrolling.\n\nStuart C. Russell of Amiga Computing praised the sound and the two-player option, but was critical of the graphics, scrolling, gameplay, and character sprites. Russell mentioned that the arcade version had 'very smooth, clear graphics and killer sound'. Gordon Hamlett of Your Amiga considered the graphics to be adequate, but criticized the presence of a loading sequence that occurs in order to restart each level whenever the player is killed. Hamlett considered it an average shoot 'em up game stated that the screen does not scroll unless the player is at the edge of it, with the result being that 'you are frequently getting shot at, and killed, by creatures that you can't actually see!'\n\nThe ZX Spectrum was criticized for attribute clash, while The Games Machine criticized the playable character sprites for being outlined 'thickly and unattractively in black,' but stated that the creatures were well animated. Your Sinclair criticized the graphics, music, difficult controls, and jerky scrolling of the ZX Spectrum version, while Sinclair User criticized the perspective and believed it would only appeal to Ghostbusters fans.\n\nLater reception\nCVGs Richard Leadbetter, reviewing the Amstrad CPC re-release, criticized the game's jerky scrolling, repetitive gameplay, and its color scheme. Commodore Format considered the C64 re-release to be worth a look, praising its sound and abundance of gameplay, while writing that the graphics 'work fairly well overall.' Zzap!64 criticized the small character sprites, as well as the bland and repetitive graphics.\n\nIn 2014, Robert Workman of Shacknews ranked it among the top three best Ghostbusters games, calling it a classic and a delight, but he stated that the main theme song is over-used. In 2016, Luke McKinney of Den of Geek also ranked it among the series' best, writing that it 'delivered the chunky pixel graphics and action-packed blasting fans had wanted all along.' McKinney stated that the game was 'nowhere near perfect,' and that it would have benefited from controls similar to Smash TV and more music, but concluded that the game 'was a fine way to fire off a few coins and proton streams.'\n\nIn 2019, Kurt Kalata of HardcoreGaming101.net stated that The Real Ghostbusters was more refined than its Japanese counterpart, and wrote that while the Ghostbusters version was 'not exactly exciting,' Meikyuu Hunter G 'is downright not fun, as you're constantly overwhelmed by enemies, whereas Ghostbusters is at least playable on the virtue of giving you more powerful weapons.' Kalata considered the main 'Ghostbusters' theme music to be well rendered, but wrote that it 'grows mindnumbing after hearing it for so many loops.' Kalata stated that the Amiga and Atari ST versions 'look okay, but have choppy animation and some annoying sound effects. The Commodore 64 version is smoother, but the hit detection is iffy.

It was released as the third single from their eleventh studio album Pollinator on June 12, 2017, in European countries as a CD single, as well as a digital download. Two versions of the single exist, the full-length album version released as a single in Europe, as well as a radio edit released to radio in America as well.\n\nBackground and cover art\nThe song was recorded in 2016, and was one of the first songs recorded for Pollinator. Lyrically, it is about recovering after a breakup after thinking that the relationship was meant to last and picking up the pieces and leaving, still remaining in love. The cover art released for the single is exactly the same blue version of the album cover used for the artwork of the promotional single 'Tonight.'\n\nCritical reception\n'Too Much' met with critical acclaim, as did the previous Pollinator's singles. The Key claims 'Pierced with synths and one of the catchiest hooks on the record, “Too Much” is another contemporary classic.' Mushroom Promotions states that this song 'proves Blondie continues to evolve almost song by song.' However, Under the Radar Magazine called it 'slick and sticky,' and 'has little to offer outside of the chorus.' The song has a rating of 3.18 out of 5 on Rate Your Music.  Despite critical acclaim, the song did not chart.\n\nTrack listings\n\nReferences\n\n2017 singles\n2016 songs\nBlondie (band) songs\nSongs written by Matthew Katz-Bohen\nSongs written by Laurel Katz-Bohen"},
{"id": "18982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular%20dystrophy", "title": "Muscular dystrophy", "text": "Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of rare neuromuscular diseases that cause progressive weakness and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. The disorders differ as to which muscles are primarily affected, the degree of weakness, how fast they worsen, and when symptoms begin. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs.\n\nOver 30 different disorders are classified as muscular dystrophies. Of those, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) accounts for approximately 50% of cases and affects males beginning around the age of four. Other relatively common muscular dystrophies include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy, whereas limb–girdle muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophy are themselves groups of several – usually ultrarare – genetic disorders.\n\nMuscular dystrophies are caused by mutations in genes, usually those involved in making muscle proteins. These mutations are either inherited from parents or may occur spontaneously during early development. Muscular dystrophies may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing.\n\nThere is no cure for any disorder from the muscular dystrophy group. Several drugs designed to address the root cause are under development, including gene therapy (Microdystrophin), and antisense drugs (Ataluren, Eteplirsen etc).  Other medications used include corticosteroids (Deflazacort), calcium channel blockers (Diltiazem) to slow skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration, anticonvulsants to control seizures and some muscle activity, and immunosuppressants (Vamorolone) to delay damage to dying muscle cells. Physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms while assisted ventilation may be required in those with weakness of breathing muscles.\n\nOutcomes depend on the specific type of disorder. Many affected people will eventually become unable to walk and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in particular is associated with shortened life expectancy.\n\nMuscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell. The word 'dystrophy' comes from the Greek dys, meaning 'no, un-' and troph- meaning 'nourish'.\n\nSigns and symptoms\nThe signs and symptoms consistent with muscular dystrophy are:\n\nCauses\nThe majority of muscular dystrophies are inherited; the different muscular dystrophies follow various inheritance patterns (X-linked, autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant). In a small percentage of patients, the disorder may have been caused by a de novo (spontaneous) mutation.\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of muscular dystrophy is based on the results of muscle biopsy, increased creatine phosphokinase (CpK3), electromyography, and genetic testing. A physical examination and the patient's medical history will help the doctor determine the type of muscular dystrophy. Specific muscle groups are affected by different types of muscular dystrophy.\n\nClassification\n\nManagement\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophy. In terms of management, physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthotic intervention (e.g., ankle-foot orthosis), speech therapy, and respiratory therapy may be helpful. Low intensity corticosteroids such as prednisone, and deflazacort may help to maintain muscle tone. Orthoses (orthopedic appliances used for support) and corrective orthopedic surgery may be needed to improve the quality of life in some cases. The cardiac problems that occur with EDMD and myotonic muscular dystrophy may require a pacemaker. The myotonia (delayed relaxation of a muscle after a strong contraction) occurring in myotonic muscular dystrophy may be treated with medications such as quinine.\n\nOccupational therapy assists the individual with MD to engage in activities of daily living (such as self-feeding and self-care activities) and leisure activities at the most independent level possible. This may be achieved with use of adaptive equipment or the use of energy-conservation techniques.  Occupational therapy may implement changes to a person's environment, both at home or work, to increase the individual's function and accessibility; furthermore, it addresses psychosocial changes and cognitive decline which may accompany MD, and provides support and education about the disease to the family and individual.\n\nPrognosis\nPrognosis depends on the individual form of muscular dystrophy. Some dystrophies cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle function, which may result in severe physical disability and a life-threatening deterioration of respiratory muscles or heart. Other dystrophies do not affect life expectancy and only cause relatively mild impairment.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1860s, descriptions of boys who grew progressively weaker, lost the ability to walk, and died at an early age became more prominent in medical journals. In the following decade, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne gave a comprehensive account of the most common and severe form of the disease, which now carries his name – Duchenne MD.\n\nSociety and culture \nIn 1966, Jerry Lewis and the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) began its annual Labor Day telecast The Jerry Lewis Telethon, which has probably done more to raise awareness of muscular dystrophy than any other event or initiative. Disability rights advocates, however, have criticized the telethon for portraying those living with the disease as deserving pity rather than respect.\n\nOn December 18, 2001, the MD CARE Act was signed into law in the US; it amends the Public Health Service Act to provide research for the various muscular dystrophies. This law also established the Muscular Dystrophy Coordinating Committee to help focus research efforts through a coherent research strategy.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\n \nGenetic disorders by system\nMyoneural junction and neuromuscular diseases\nWikipedia medicine articles ready to translate\nMedical conditions with no known cure\n\nno:Duchenne muskeldystrofi"},

{"id": "40977812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic%20Theology%20%28Ficino%29", "title": "Platonic Theology (Ficino)", "text": "The Platonic Theology (Latin: Theologia platonica de immortalitate animorum) is a work consisting of eighteen books by Marsilio Ficino.  Ficino wrote it between 1469 and 1474 and it was published in 1482.  It has been described as Ficino's philosophical masterpiece.\n\nContent\nThe main concern of the work is to set forth a rational argument for the immortality of the human soul. Ficino ascribes to the human soul a middle position in a five-part division of things: between God and angelic beings on the one side, and qualities and bodies on the other. Ficino believed that Platonism was compatible with Christianity, unlike Aristotelianism, which, though ambiguous on the subject of immortality, had been philosophically ascendant since the thirteenth century.   \n\nFicino's work was also meant to compete with the ancient Platonic Theology of Proclus.  Proclus was widely available to Western scholars via the thirteenth-century translations of the Flemish Dominican, William of Moerbeke.  Ficino viewed Proclus as a non-Christian Platonist, and moreover derivative of the 'Platonic theology' of Dionysius the Areopagite.  Ficino wanted to offer a similar style of Platonist philosophy which nonetheless affirmed Christian belief.\n\nAudience and influence\nFicino directed the Platonic Theology toward his fellow Renaissance ingeniosi, or intellectuals, in the Republic of Florence, including the political elites. In agreement with Plato, in the work Ficino argued for the immortality of the soul, and the Fifth Council of the Lateran was probably influenced by this in its decree Apostolici regiminis against Christian mortalism.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n Allen, Michael J.

{"id": "46958817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menotec", "title": "Menotec", "text": "Menotec was an infrastructure project funded by the Norwegian Research Council (2010–2012) with the aim of transcribing and annotating a text corpus of Old Norwegian texts.\n\nDescription\nThe transcribed texts have been (and will be) published in the Medieval Nordic Text Archive, while the annotated texts have been published in the treebank of the PROIEL project, as well as being made accessible through the INESS portal. The funding for the project lasted for the three years 2010–2012, but the project work continues within new contexts.\n\nAs a first step, transcriptions were made of eight central Old Norwegian law manuscripts containing approx. 480,000 words. The transcriptions were made by Anna C. Horn, and afterwards proofread by several colleagues at the University of Oslo:\n\n- Holm perg 34 4to (hand f, ca. 1276–1300), partly by the scribe Eiríkr Þróndarson (hand f), often regarded as the codex optimus of Landslǫg Magnúss Hákonarsonar (The Law-Code of Magnús Hákonarson the Lawmender)\n- AM 78 4to (ca. 1276–1300)\n- AM 302 fol (ca. 1300), by the scribe Þorgeirr Hákonarson\n- AM 305 fol (hand a, ca. 1300), by the scribe Þorgeirr Hákonarson (hand a)\n- AM 56 4to (ca. 1300), by the scribe Þorgeirr Hákonarson\n- Holm perg 30 4to (hand b, ca. 1300–1325)\n- AM 60 4to (hand b, ca. 1320), used as the base codex for Landslǫg Magnúss Hákonarsonar in the edition of Norges Gamle Love, vol. 2\n- Upps DG 8 I (hands a and b, ca. 1300–1350)\n\nAll but AM 78 4to include Landslǫg Magnúss Hákonarsonar (concluded in 1276), and most of them also contain several other law texts.\n\nAs a second step, a full linguistic annotation was made of four major Old Norwegian manuscripts:\n\n- The Old Norwegian Homily Book, Gammelnorsk homiliebok, in AM 619 4to (ca. 1200–1225)\n- The legendary saga of St Olaf, Óláfs saga ins helga, in Upps DG 8 II (ca. 1225–1250)\n- Strengleikar in Upps DG 4–7 4to (ca. 1270)\n- Landslǫg Magnúss Hákonarsonar in the above-mentioned ms. Holm perg 34 4to (ca. 1276–1300)\n\nThese four mss. have been annotated morphologically (adding the lemma and the grammatical form of each word) as well as syntactically. The syntactic annotation is based on dependency analysis, as this has been developed in the PROIEL project.\n\nThe corpus of these four mss. counts approx. 200,000 words, but will in the coming years be extended by at least ca. 50,000 words. Menotec is the first project offering a syntactic annotation of Old Norwegian. On the  PROIEL site, the Old Norwegian texts will join a central Old Icelandic work, the Poetic Edda in GKS 2365 4to (a manuscript often referred to as Codex Regius). The Eddic poems have been annotated along the same lines as the texts in Menotec. Furthermore, several other Early Germanic and Romance texts will be found on the PROIEL site.\n\nThe Menotec project was led by Christian-Emil Ore at the University of Oslo, and included several other participants at this university, Karl G. Johansson, Anna C. Horn, Signe Laake, Kari Kinn, Dag Haug and Hanne Eckhoff. The University of Bergen was a partner in the project, and at this university, Odd Einar Haugen was leading the work of linguistic annotation. Also from Bergen, Fartein Th. Øverland, participated in the project, and from Iceland, Haraldur Bernharðsson and Eirikur Kristjánsson. The name Menotec is not actually an acronym, but is derived from the project name Menota (which in its turn is an acronym for the Medieval Nordic Text Archive).\n\nGuidelines for the annotation have been published by Haugen and Øverland and are available in parallel versions in Norwegian and English, Retningslinjer and Guidelines. These guidelines explain the conventions of the morphological and syntactic annotation and also give a pragmatic introduction to dependency analysis for Old Norwegian, covering a wide range of annotation problems which arose during the project.\n\nFurther information on the encoding and annotation of Medieval Nordic sources will be found on the site of the Medieval Nordic Text Archive. Since the texts have been transcribed on a diplomatic level, some special characters are needed for the display of the texts. The encoding of these characters follow the recommendations of the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative, and several suitable fonts can be downloaded free of charge from the website of this project.\n\nSee also \n Text corpus\n Dependency grammar\n Part-of-speech tagging\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Medieval Nordic Text Archive website\n Medieval Unicode Font Initiative website\n The PROIEL project at the University of Oslo\n\nNorwegian\nNorwegian manuscripts"},

{"id": "3864107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crooked%20Fingers", "title": "Crooked Fingers", "text": "Crooked Fingers was an American North Carolina-based indie rock band, led by the former Archers of Loaf lead singer Eric Bachmann.  The band was previously based in Seattle, Washington and Atlanta, Georgia before moving to Denver. The band released albums on WARM Records and Merge Records before going completely independent in 2008. They tended to have a rotating lineup, with Bachmann the only constant. Bachmann retired the name Crooked Fingers in January 2016 with a pair of shows in New York City and Durham, NC, playing the first two records in their entirety with a string ensemble and has since been releasing albums under his name.\n\nHistory\nFollowing the breakup of Archers of Loaf in 1998, Bachmann started work on a solo project that he named Crooked Fingers. The first release of this project, a self-titled release of various songs he had written, was released by WARM in 2000.  It was followed shortly after by a second album on WARM, Bring on the Snakes.\n\nFollowing the release of Bring on the Snakes, Crooked Fingers signed to Merge. Under that label, Crooked Fingers released Reservoir Songs EP in 2002, composed of cover songs of artists such as Neil Diamond and Queen. In 2003, they released Red Devil Dawn, their first full-length for Merge.\n\nThey released Dignity and Shame in 2005.\n\nIn October 2008, the band released the album Forfeit/Fortune. The band declined to sign a deal with any label, pursuing a direct-to-retail approach supported by sales at shows, the band's website, iTunes, and eMusic.\n\n2011's 'Breaks in the Armor' returned the band to Merge Records, and featured the addition of Bachmann's wife Liz Durrett to the lineup.  Merge also re-released the first two Crooked Fingers records in January 2016, including numerous demos alongside the albums.  This re-release, however, coincided with Bachmann's retiring of the moniker Crooked Fingers and was marked by two shows in NYC and Durham, NC, where he played the two albums in their entirety with string musicians.\n\nCrooked Fingers toured the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, both as a solo act and with a full band.  They were featured on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic and on National Public Radio's World Cafe in May 2005.  On the 2005 U.S./Canada Tour, Matt Gentling, former member of Archers of Loaf, played the bass. The rotation of members in the band have included such musicians as Lara Meyerratken, R.L. Martin, Jo Jameson, Neil Swank, Barton Carroll, Kyle Johnson, and Dov Friedman.  A 2008 US tour featured the musicians on Forfeit/Fortune: Miranda Brown, Elin Palmer and Tim Husmann.\n\nDiscography\nCrooked Fingers has released a number of albums and EPs on different labels.\n\nStudio albums\n Crooked Fingers (Warm Records, 2000)\n Bring On the Snakes (Warm Records, 2001)\n Red Devil Dawn (Merge Records, 2003)\n Dignity and Shame (Merge Records, 2005)\n Forfeit/Fortune (Constant Artists/Red Pig, 2008)\n Breaks in the Armor (Merge Records, 2011)\n\nSingles and EPs\n 'Atchafalyan Death Waltz' (7') (Sub Pop, 1999)\n 'Broken Man' (7') (Red Pig, 1999)\n Reservoir Songs EP (Merge Records, 2002)\n 'Sleep All Summer' (Live) (7') (Eastern Fiction, 2005)\n Reservoir Songs Volume II Vinyl EP/Download Only (Foreign Leisure. 2010)\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Label site\n 'Sleep All Summer' (7') Label Site\n Lazy-i Interview: October 2004\n Billboard article: July 2008\n Crooked Fingers at eMusic\n\nIndie rock musical groups from Washington (state)\nMusical groups from Seattle\nMerge Records artists\nWarm Electronic Recordings artists"},

{"id": "2712500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Office%202007", "title": "Microsoft Office 2007", "text": "Microsoft Office 2007 (codenamed Office 12) is a version of Microsoft Office, a family of office suites and productivity software for Windows, developed and published by Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on November 3, 2006; it was subsequently made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, and later to retail on January 30, 2007, shortly after the completion of Windows Vista. The ninth major release of Office for Windows, Office 2007 was preceded by Office 2003 and succeeded by Office 2010. The Mac OS X equivalent, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, was released on January 15, 2008.\n\nOffice 2007 introduced a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, which uses ribbons and an Office menu instead of menu bars and toolbars. Office 2007 also introduced Office Open XML file formats as the default file formats in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. The new formats are intended to facilitate the sharing of information between programs, improve security, reduce the size of documents, and enable new recovery scenarios.\n\nOffice 2007 is incompatible with Windows 2000 and earlier versions of Windows. Office 2007 is compatible Windows XP SP2 or later, Windows Server 2003 SP1 or later, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 10. It is not officially supported on Windows 11. It is the last version of Microsoft Office to support the 64—bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the 32—bit versions of Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows Vista versions below SP1; as the following version, Microsoft Office 2010 will only support Windows XP 32-bit SP3 or later, Windows Server 2003 32-bit SP2 or later and Windows Vista SP1 or later.\n\nOffice 2007 includes new applications and server-side tools, including Microsoft Office Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses, which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office SharePoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports Excel Services, a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.\n\nWith Microsoft FrontPage discontinued, Microsoft SharePoint Designer, which is aimed towards development of SharePoint portals, becomes part of the Office 2007 family. Its designer-oriented counterpart, Microsoft Expression Web, is targeted for general web development. However, neither application has been included in Office 2007 software suites.\n\nSpeech recognition functionality has been removed from the individual programs in the Office 2007 suite, as Windows Speech Recognition was integrated into Windows Vista. Windows XP users must install a previous version of Office to use speech recognition features.\n\nAccording to Forrester Research, as of May 2010, Microsoft Office 2007 is used in 81% of enterprises it surveyed (its sample comprising 115 North American and European enterprise and SMB decision makers).\n\nMainstream support for Office 2007 ended on October 9, 2012, and extended support ended on October 10, 2017. On August 27, 2021, Microsoft announced that Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 would be cut off from connecting to Microsoft 365 Exchange servers on November 1, 2021.\n\nDevelopment\nMicrosoft announced Beta 1 of Office 2007 with the revelation of the ribbon on March 9, 2006, at CeBIT in Germany.\n\nBeta 2 was announced by Bill Gates at WinHEC 2006, and was initially released to the public at no cost from Microsoft's web site. However, because of an unprecedented number of downloads, a fee of $1.50 was introduced for each product downloaded after August 2, 2006, The beta was updated on September 14, 2006, in Beta 2 Technical Refresh (Beta2TR). It included an updated user interface, better accessibility support, improvements in the robustness of the platform, and greater functionality.\n\nOffice 2007 was released to volume licensing customers on November 30, 2006, and to the general public on January 30, 2007. Mainstream support ended on October 9, 2012. Extended support ended on October 10, 2017.\n\nService packs\nSince the initial release of Microsoft Office 2007, three service packs containing updates as well as additional features have been released.  Microsoft Office 2007 Service Packs are cumulative, so previous Service Packs are not a prerequisite for installation.\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1 was released on December 11, 2007. Official documentation claims that SP1 is not simply a rollup of publicly released patches, but that it also contains fixes for a total of 481 issues throughout the entire Office suite. Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 2 was released on April 28, 2009. It added improved support for ODF, XPS and PDF standards, and included several bug fixes. Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 3 was released on October 25, 2011.\n\nEditions\n\n1 Office Customization Tool is used to customize the installation of Office 2007 by creating a Windows Installer patch file (.MSP) and replacing the Custom Installation Wizard and Custom Deployment Wizard included in earlier versions of the Office Resource Kit that created a Windows Installer Transform (.MST).\n\nVolume licensing\nEligible employees of companies with volume license agreements for Microsoft Office receive additional tools, including enterprise content management, electronic forms, Information Rights Management capabilities and copies for use on a home computer.\n\nNew features\n\nUser interface\nThe new user interface (UI), officially known as Fluent User Interface, has been implemented in the core Microsoft Office applications: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, and in the item inspector used to create or edit individual items in Outlook. These applications have been selected for the UI overhaul because they center around document authoring. The rest of the applications in the suite changed to the new UI in subsequent versions. The default font used in this edition is Calibri. Original prototypes of the new user interface were revealed at MIX 2008 in Las Vegas.\n\nOffice button\nThe Office 2007 button, located on the top-left of the window, replaces the File menu and provides access to functionality common across all Office applications, including opening, saving, printing, and sharing a file. It can also close the application. Users can also choose color schemes for the interface. A notable accessibility improvement is that the Office button follows Fitts's law.\n\nRibbon \n\nThe ribbon, a panel that houses a fixed arrangement of command buttons and icons, organizes commands as a set of tabs, each grouping relevant commands. The ribbon is present in Microsoft Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Access 2007 and some Outlook 2007 windows. The ribbon is not user customizable in Office 2007. Each application has a different set of tabs that exposes functions that the application offers. For example, while Excel has a tab for the graphing capabilities, Word does not; instead it has tabs to control the formatting of a text document. Within each tab, various related options may be grouped together. The ribbon is designed to make the features of the application more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse clicks as compared to the menu-based UI used prior to Office 2007. Moving the mouse scroll wheel while on any of the tabs on the ribbon cycles—through the tabs. The ribbon can be minimized by double clicking the active section's title, such as the Home text in the picture below. Office 2007 does not natively support removing, modifying or replacing ribbon. Third party add-ins, however, can bring menus and toolbars back to Office 2007 or customize the ribbon commands. Add-ins that restore menus and toolbars include Classic Menu for Office, ToolbarToggle, and Ubitmenu. Others like RibbonCustomizer enable the customization of ribbons. Office 2010 does allow user customization of the ribbon out of the box.\n\nContextual Tabs\nSome tabs, called Contextual Tabs, appear only when certain objects are selected. Contextual Tabs expose functionality specific only to the object with focus. For example, selecting a picture brings up the Pictures tab, which presents options for dealing with the picture. Similarly, focusing on a table exposes table-related options in a specific tab. Contextual Tabs remain hidden except when an applicable object is selected.\n\nLive Preview\nMicrosoft Office 2007 also introduces a feature called Live Preview, which temporarily applies formatting on the focused text or object when any formatting button is moused-over. The temporary formatting is removed when the mouse pointer is moved from the button. This allows users to have a preview of how the option would affect the appearance of the object, without actually applying it.\n\nMini Toolbar\nThe new Mini Toolbar is a small toolbar with basic formatting commands that appears within the document editing area, much like a context menu. When the mouse selects part of the text, Mini Toolbar appears close to selected text. It remains semi-transparent until the mouse pointer is hovered on it, to avoid obstructing what is underneath. Mini Toolbar can also be made to appear by right-clicking in the editing area or via  key on keyboard, in which case it appears near the cursor, above or below the traditional context menu. Mini Toolbar is not customizable in Office 2007, but can be turned off.\n\nQuick Access Toolbar\nThe Quick Access toolbar (by default) sits in the title bar and serves as a repository of most used functions, such as save, undo/redo and print. It is customizable, although this feature is limited, compared to toolbars in previous Office versions. Any command available in the entire Office application can be added to the Quick Access toolbar, including commands not available on the ribbon as well as macros. Keyboard shortcuts for any of the commands on the toolbar are also fully customizable, similar to previous Office versions.\n\nOther UI features\n Super-tooltips, or screentips, that can house formatted text and even images, are used to provide detailed descriptions of what most buttons do.\n A zoom slider present in the bottom-right corner, allowing for dynamic and rapid magnification of documents.\n The status bar is fully customizable. Users can right click the status bar and add or remove what they want the status bar to display.\n\nSmartArt\nSmartArt, found under the Insert tab in the ribbon in PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Outlook, is a new group of editable and formatted diagrams. There are 115 preset SmartArt graphics layout templates in categories such as list, process, cycle, and hierarchy. When an instance of a SmartArt is inserted, a Text Pane appears next to it to guide the user through entering text in the hierarchical levels. Each SmartArt graphic, based on its design, maps the text outline, automatically resized for best fit, onto the graphic. There are a number of 'quick styles' for each graphic that apply largely different 3D effects to the graphic, and the graphic's shapes and text can be formatted through shape styles and WordArt styles. In addition, SmartArt graphics change their colors, fonts, and effects to match the document's theme.\n\nFile formats\n\nOffice Open XML\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 introduced a new file format, called Office Open XML, as the default file format. Such files are saved using an extra X letter in their extension (.docx/xlsx/pptx/etc.). However, it can still save documents in the old format, which is compatible with previous versions. Alternatively, Microsoft has made available a free add-on known as the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack that lets Office 2000, XP, and 2003 open, edit, and save documents created under the newer 2007 format.\n\nOffice Open XML is based on XML and uses the ZIP file container. According to Microsoft, documents created in this format are up to 75% smaller than the same documents saved with previous Microsoft Office file formats, owing to the ZIP data compression.\n\nFiles containing macros are saved with an extra M letter in their extension instead (.docm/xlsm/pptm/etc.).\n\nPDF\nInitially, Microsoft promised to support exporting to Portable Document Format (PDF) in Office 2007. However, due to legal objections from Adobe Systems, Office 2007 originally did not offer PDF support out of the box, but rather as a separate free download. However, starting with Service Pack 2, Office allows users to natively export PDF files.\n\nXPS\nOffice 2007 documents can also be exported as XPS documents. This is part of Service Pack 2 and prior to that, was available as a free plug-in in a separate download.\n\nOpenDocument\n\nMicrosoft backs an open-source effort to support OpenDocument in Office 2007, as well as earlier versions (up to Office 2000), through a converter add-in for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and also a command-line utility. As of 2008, the project supports conversion between ODF and Office Open XML file formats for all three applications. According to ODF Alliance this support falls short and substantial improvements are still needed for interoperability in real-world situations.\nThird-party plugins able to read from and write to the ISO-standard Open Document Format (ODF) are available as a separate download.\n\nOffice 2007 Service Pack 2 adds native support for the OpenDocument Format. The ODF Alliance has released test results on ODF support of Office 2007 SP2, concluding that Office ODF support, both SP2 and other add-ons, have 'serious shortcomings that, left unaddressed, would break the open standards based interoperability that the marketplace, especially governments, is demanding'. Particularly, SP2 has no support for encrypted ODF files and has limited interoperability with other ODF spreadsheet implementations.\n\nThe ISO/IEC 26300 OpenDocument standard specifies encryption of files, which is based on sha1, Blowfish, and RFC 2898.\nMicrosoft Office 2007 SP2 does not support reading and writing encrypted (password protected) ODF files. Users are presented with a message: “cannot use password protection using the ODF format.”\n\nThe ISO/IEC 26300 OpenDocument standard has no spreadsheet formula language included (or referenced) in the standard specification. Office 2007 SP2 uses the spreadsheet formula language specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 Office Open XML open standard when creating ODF documents. According to the ODF Alliance report 'ODF spreadsheets created in Excel 2007 SP2 do not in fact conform to ODF 1.1 because Excel 2007 incorrectly encodes formulas with cell addresses. Section 8.3.1 of ODF 1.1 says that addresses in formulas 'start with a '[' and end with a ']'.' In Excel 2007 cell addresses were not enclosed with the necessary square brackets.' The ISO/IEC 26300 specification states that the semantics and the syntax depends on the used namespace, which is implementation dependent, leaving the syntax implementation defined as well.\n\nMicrosoft stated that they consider adding support for an official ODF formula language (OpenFormula), once a future version of the ISO/IEC 26300 standard specification includes one.\n\nMicrosoft's ODF spreadsheet support in SP2 is not fully inter-operable with other implementations of OpenDocument, such as the IBM Symphony, which use the non-standardized OpenOffice.org 2.x formula language, and OpenOffice.org 3.x, which uses a draft of OpenFormula. The company had previously reportedly stated that 'where ODF 1.1 is ambiguous or incomplete, the Office implementation can be guided by current practice in OpenOffice.org, mainly, and other implementations including KOffice and AbiWord. Peter Amstein and the Microsoft Office team are reluctant to make liberal use of extension mechanisms, even though provided in ODF 1.1. They want to avoid all appearance of an embrace-extend attempt.'\n\nThe EU investigated Microsoft Office OpenDocument Format support to see if it provided consumers greater choice.\n\nMetadata\nIn Office 2007, Microsoft introduced the Document Inspector, an integral metadata removal tool that strips Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents of information such as author name and comments and other 'metadata'.\n\nUser assistance system\nIn Microsoft Office 2007, the Office Assistants were eliminated in favour of a new online help system. One of its features is the extensive use of Super Tooltips, which explain in about one paragraph what each function performs. Some of them also use diagrams or pictures. These appear and disappear like normal tooltips, and replace normal tooltips in many areas. The Help content also directly integrates searching and viewing Office Online articles.\n\nCollaboration features\n\nSharePoint\nMicrosoft Office 2007 includes features geared towards collaboration and data sharing. As such, Microsoft Office 2007 features server components for applications such as Excel, which work in conjunction with SharePoint Services, to provide a collaboration platform. SharePoint works with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, which is used to host a SharePoint site, and uses IIS and ASP.NET 2.0. Excel server exposes Excel Services, which allows any worksheet to be created, edited and maintained via web browsers. It features Excel Web Access, the client-side component which is used to render the worksheet on a browser, Excel Calculation Service which is the server side component which populates the worksheet with data and perform calculations, and Excel Web Services that extends Excel functionalities into individual web services. SharePoint can also be used to host Word documents for collaborative editing, by sharing a document. SharePoint can also be used to hold PowerPoint slides in a Slide Library, from which the slides can be used as a formatting template. It also notifies users of a slide automatically in case the source slide is modified. Also by using SharePoint, PowerPoint can manage shared review of presentations. Any SharePoint hosted document can be accessed from the application which created the document or from other applications such as a browser or Microsoft Office Outlook.\n\nGroove\nMicrosoft Office 2007 also includes Groove, which brings collaborative features to a peer-to-peer paradigm. Groove can host documents, including presentations, workbooks and others, created in Microsoft Office 2007 application in a shared workspace, which can then be used in collaborative editing of documents. Groove can also be used in managing workspace sessions, including access control of the workspace. To collaborate on one or more documents, a Workspace must be created, and then those who are to work on it must be invited. Any file shared on the workspace are automatically shared among all participants. The application also provides real-time messaging, including one-to-one as well as group messaging, and presence features, as well as monitoring workspace activities with alerts, which are raised when pre-defined set of activities are detected. Groove also provides features for conflict resolution for conflicting edits. Schedules for a collaboration can also be decided by using a built-in shared calendar, which can also be used to keep track of the progress of a project. However, the calendar is not compatible with Microsoft Outlook.\n\nThemes and Quick Styles\nMicrosoft Office 2007 places more emphasis on Document Themes and Quick Styles. The Document Theme defines the colors, fonts and graphic effects for a document. Almost everything that can be inserted into a document is automatically styled to match the overall document theme creating a consistent document design. The new Office Theme file format (.THMX) is shared between Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook email messages. Similar themes are also available for data reports in Access and Project or shapes in Visio.\n\nQuick Styles are galleries with a range of styles based on the current theme. There are quick styles galleries for text, tables, charts, SmartArt, WordArt and more. The style range goes from simple/light to more graphical/darker.\n\nApplication-specific changes\n\nWord\n\n New style sheets (quick styles) and ability to switch easily among them.\n Default font now Calibri instead of Times New Roman, as featured in previous versions of Microsoft Office.\n Word count listed by default in the status bar. The word count dynamically updates as you type.\n New contextual spell checker, signified by a wavy blue underline to the traditional wavy red underline for misspellings and wavy green underline for grammar errors, sometimes catches incorrect usage of correctly spelled words, such as in 'I think we will loose this battle'.\n Translation tool tip option available for English (U.S.), French (France), and Spanish (International Sort). When selected, hovering the mouse cursor over a word displays its translation in the particular language. Non-English versions have different sets of languages. Other languages can be added by using a separate multilingual pack.\n Automated generation of citations and bibliographies according to defined style rules, including APA, Chicago, and MLA. Changing style updates all references automatically. Connect to web services to access online reference databases.\n Redesigned native mathematical equation support with TeX-like linear input/edit language or GUI. Also supports the Unicode Plain Text Encoding of Mathematics.\n Preset gallery of cover pages with fields for Author, Title, Date, Abstract, etc. Cover pages follow the theme of the document (found under the Page Layout tab).\n Document comparison engine updated to support moves, differences in tables, and also easy to follow tri-pane view of original document, new document, and differences.\n Full screen reading layout that shows two pages at a time with maximal screen usage, plus a few critical tools for reviewing.\n Building Blocks, which lets one save frequently used content, so that they are easily accessible for further use. Building blocks can have data mapped controls in them to allow for form building or structured document authoring.\n The ability to save multiple versions of a document (which had existed since Word 97) has been removed.\n Blog entries can be authored in Word itself and uploaded directly to a blog. Supported blogging sites include Windows Live Spaces, WordPress, SharePoint, Blogger, Telligent Community etc.\n Drops function for Insert/Picture/From Scanner or Camera. Can be added manually.\n Drops the 'Bullets and Numbering' dialog boxes and rich, easily controlled range of options for formatting Outline Numbered lists\n For Indian languages, proofing tools were introduced in Office for Bengali, Malayalam, Odia, Konkani and Assamese\n\nOutlook\n\n As a major change in Outlook 2007, Exchange 5.5 support has been dropped. Like Evolution, Outlook Express and Entourage, Outlook now works only with Exchange 2000 and above.\n Word becomes the default text editor for this and all subsequent versions.\n Outlook now indexes (using the Windows Search APIs) the e-mails, contacts, tasks, calendar entries, RSS feeds and other items, to speed up searches. As such, it features word-wheeled search, which displays results as characters are typed.\n Search folders, which are saved searches, have been updated to include RSS feeds as well. Search folders can be created with a specific search criteria, specifying the subject, type and other attributes of the information being searched. When a search folder is opened, all matching items for the search are automatically retrieved and grouped up.\n Outlook now supports text-messages and SMSs, when used in conjunction with Exchange Server 2007 Unified Messaging.\n Outlook includes a reader for RSS feeds, which use the Windows Common Feeds Store. RSS subscription URLs can be shared via e-mails; updates can also be pushed to a mobile device.\n Outlook can now support multiple calendars being worked with simultaneously. It also includes a side-by-side view for calendars, where each calendar is displayed in a different tab, and allows easy comparison of them. Outlook also supports web calendars. Calendars can be shared with other users, and also exported as a HTML file for viewing by others who do not have Outlook installed.\n Calendar view shows which tasks are due.\n Flagged e-mails and notes can also be converted to Task items.\n Outlook includes a To Do Bar, which consolidates appointment, calendar, and task items in a single view.\n Outlook includes a Windows SideShow Calendar Gadget\n Online or offline editing of all Microsoft Office 2007 documents via a SharePoint site. All edits are automatically synchronized.\n Contacts can be shared among users, via e-mail, Exchange Server or a SharePoint site.\n Attachment preview allows users to view Office e-mail attachments in the reading pane rather than having to open another program.\n HTML in e-mails is now rendered using the Microsoft Word rendering engine which disallows several HTML tags like object, script, iframe etc. along with several CSS properties.\n\nMicrosoft Office Outlook can also include an optional Business Contact Manager (included on a separate installation disc in Office 2007 Small Business and above) which allows management of business contacts and their sales and marketing activities. Phone calls, e-mails, appointments, notes and other business metrics can be managed for each contact. It can also keep a track of billable time for each contact on the Outlook Calendar. Based on these data, a consolidated report view can be generated by Microsoft Office Outlook with Business Contact Manager. The data can be further analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel. This data can also be shared using SharePoint Services.\n\nExcel\n\n Support up to 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns (XFD) in a single worksheet, with 32,767 characters in a single cell (17,179,869,184 cells in a worksheet, 562,932,773,552,128 characters in a worksheet)\n Conditional Formatting introduces support for three new features — Color Scales, Icon Sets and Data Bars\n Color Scales, which automatically color the background of a group of cells with different colors according to the values.\n Icon sets, which precede the text in a cell with an icon that represent some aspect of the value of the cell with respect to other values in a group of cells, can also be applied. Icons can be conditionally applied to show up only when certain criteria are met, such as a cross showing up on an invalid value, where the condition for invalidity can be specified by the user.\n Data Bars show as a gradient bar in the background of a cell the contribution of the cell value in the group.\n Column titles can optionally show options to control the layout of the column.\n Multithreaded calculation of formulae, to speed up large calculations, especially on multi-core/multi-processor systems.\n User Defined Functions (UDF), which are custom functions written to supplement Excel's set of built-in functions, supports the increased number of cells and columns. UDFs now can also be multithreaded. Server side UDFs are based on the .NET Managed code.\n Importing data from external sources, such as a database, has been upgraded. Data can also be imported from formatted tables and reports, which do not have a regular grid structure\n Formula Autocomplete, automatically suggests function names, arguments and named ranges, and automatically completing them if desired, based on the characters entered. Formulae can refer to a table as well\n CUBE functions which allow importing data, including set aggregated data, from data analysis services, such as SQL Server Analysis Services\n Page Layout view, to author spreadsheets in a way that mirrors the formatting of the printed document\n PivotTables, which are used to create analysis reports out of sets of data, can now support hierarchical data by displaying a row in the table with a '+' icon, which, when clicked, shows more rows regarding it, which can also be hierarchical. PivotTables can also be sorted and filtered independently, and conditional formatting used to highlight trends in the data.\n Filters, now includes a Quick filter option allowing the selection of multiple items from a drop down list of items in the column. The option to filter based on color has been added to the choices available.\n Excel features a new charting engine, which supports advanced formatting, including 3D rendering, transparencies and shadows. Chart layouts can also be customized to highlight various trends in the data.\n\nPowerPoint\n\n Improvements to text rendering to support text based graphics.\n Rendering of 3D graphics.\n Support for many more sound file formats such as .mp3 and .wma.\n Support for tables and enhanced support for table pasting from Excel.\n Slide Library, which lets you reuse any slide or presentation as a template.

Anyone can edit even while not connected and changes are merged automatically across machines when a connection is made. Changes are labeled with author and change time/date.\n Notebooks can be synchronized between two or more machines without an Internet connection when stored on removable media such as an SD card or USB flash drive; changes made to a notebook on a machine when removable media is disconnected will be synced with the notebook when the media is reinserted to that machine. To prevent potential synchronization issues associated with drive mapping during reinsertion, OneNote 2007 associates notebooks with unique device identifiers rather than drive letters to ensure that changes are successfully synced.\n Notebook templates.\n Word-wheeled search is also present in OneNote, which also indexes notes.\n Synchronization of Tasks with Outlook 2007. Also Outlook can send mails to OneNote, or open pages in OneNote that are linked to tasks, contacts, appointments/meetings.\n Support for tables. Using tabs to create tabular structure automatically converts it to a table.\n Optical character recognition is performed on images (e.g., brochures, photos, prints, scans, screen clips) so that any text that appears in them is searchable. Handwritten text on a tablet PC is also searchable.\n Words that are included in audio and video recordings are also tagged and indexed, so that they can be searched.\n Notes can have hyperlinks among themselves, or from outside OneNote to a specific point on a page.\n Embedding documents in notes.\n Extensibility support for add-ins.\n Drawing tools for creating diagrams in OneNote.\n Typing any arithmetic expression, followed by '=' results in the result of the calculation being displayed.\n OneNote Import Printer Driver, where any application can print to a virtual printer for OneNote and the 'printed' document is imported to the notebook; OCR is performed on the text that appears in the printed document to facilitate searches.\n OneNote Mobile is included for Smartphones and some PocketPC devices. Syncs notes two-way with OneNote. Takes text, voice, and photo notes.\n\nAccess\n\n Access now includes support for a broader range of data types, including documents and images.\n Whenever any table is updated, all reports referencing the table are also updated.\n Dropdown lists for a table can be modified in place.\n Lookup Fields, which get their values by 'looking up' some value in a table, have been updated to support multi valued lookups.\n Many new preset schemata are included.\n Access can synchronize with Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Office SharePoint Server 2007. This feature enables a user to use Access reports while using a server-based, backed-up, IT managed version of the data.\n\nPublisher\n\n Templates automatically fill out with information such as company name, logo etc., wherever applicable.\n Frequently used content can be stored in Content Store for quick access.\n A document can be automatically converted from one publication type, such as a newsletter, to another publication type, say a web page.\n Save as PDF supports commercial printing quality PDF.\n Catalog Merge can create publication content automatically by retrieving data, including text, images and other supported types, from an external data source.\n Design Checker, which is used to find design inconsistencies, has been updated.\n\nInfoPath\n\n InfoPath designed forms can now be used from a browser, provided the server is running InfoPath Forms Services in SharePoint 2007 or Office Forms Server.\n A form can be sent out to people via e-mail. Such forms can be filled out from Outlook 2007 itself.\n Automatic conversion of forms in Word and Excel to InfoPath forms. Forms can also be exported to Excel.\n Forms can be published to a network share or to SharePoint Server.\n Adding data validation, using validation formulae, and conditional formatting features without manually writing code.\n Print Layout view for designing forms in a view that mirror the printed layout.

Doing so, the shapes are formatted according to the data. The data, and hence the shapes, are updated periodically. Such shapes can also be formatted manually using the Data Graphics feature.\n AutoConnect : Link easily two shapes.\n Data Link : Link data to shapes.\n Data Graphics : Dynamic objects (text and images) linked with external data.\n New Theme behaviour and new shapes.\n\nProject\n\n Ability to create custom templates.\n Any change in the project plan or schedule highlights everything else that is affected.\n Analyze changes without actually committing them. Changes can also be done and undone programmatically, to automate analysis of different changes.\n Improved cost resource management and analysis for projects.\n Project data can be used to automatically create charts and diagrams in Microsoft Office Excel and Microsoft Office Visio, respectively.\n The project schedule can be managed as 3D Gantt chart\n Sharing project data with the help of SharePoint Services.\n\nSharePoint Designer\n\nMicrosoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 is new addition to the Office suite, replacing discontinued FrontPage for users of SharePoint. People who don't use SharePoint can use Microsoft Expression Web\n Supports features and constructs that expose SharePoint functionality\n Supports ASP.NET 2.0 and Windows Workflow Foundation\n Support for creating workflows and data reports, from external data sources\n Can optionally render XML using XSLT\n\nServer components\n\nSharePoint Server 2007\n\nMicrosoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 allows sharing and collaborative editing of Office 2007 documents. It allows central storage of documents and management of Office documents, throughout the enterprise. These documents can be accessed either by the applications which created them, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, or a web browser. Documents can also be managed through pre-defined policies that let users create and publish shared content, through a SharePoint site.\n\nSharePoint Server allows searching of all Office documents which are being managed by it, centrally, thereby making data more accessible. It also provides access control for documents. Specialized server components can plug into the SharePoint Server to extend the functionality of the server, such as Excel Services exposing data analysis services for Excel services. Data from other data sources can also be merged with Office data.\n\nSharePoint also lets users personalize the SharePoint sites, filtering content they are interested in. SharePoint documents can also be locally cached by clients for offline editing; the changes are later merged.\n\nForms Server 2007\n\nMicrosoft Office Forms Server 2007 allows InfoPath forms to be accessed and filled out using any browser, including mobile phone browsers. Forms Server 2007 also supports using a database or other data source as the back-end for the form. Additionally, it allows centralized deployment and management of forms. Forms Server 2007 hosted forms also support data validation and conditional formatting, as does their InfoPath counterpart. It also supports advanced controls like Repeating section and Repeating table. However, some InfoPath controls cannot be used if it must be hosted on a Forms server.\n\nGroove Server 2007\n\nMicrosoft Office Groove Server 2007 is for centrally managing all deployments of Microsoft Office Groove 2007 in the enterprise. It enables using Active Directory for Groove user accounts, and create Groove Domains, with individual policy settings. It allows Groove workspaces to be hosted at the server, and the files in the workspaces made available for collaborative editing via the Groove client. It also includes the Groove Server Data Bridge component to allow communication between data stored at both Groove clients and servers and external applications.\n\nProject Server 2007\n\nMicrosoft Office Project Server 2007 allows one to centrally manage and coordinate projects. It allows budget and resource tracking, and activity plan management. The project data and reports can also be further analyzed using Cube Building Service. The project management data can be accessed from a browser as well.\n\nProject Portfolio Server 2007\n\nMicrosoft Office Project Portfolio Server 2007 allows creation of a project portfolio, including workflows, hosted centrally, so that the information is available throughout the enterprise, even from a browser. It also aids in centralized data aggregation regarding the project planning and execution, and in visualizing and analyzing the data to optimize the project plan. It can also support multiple portfolios per project, to track different aspects of it. It also includes reporting tools to create consolidated reports out of the project data.\n\nPerformancePoint Server 2007\n\nMicrosoft PerformancePoint Server allows users to monitor, analyze, and plan their business as well as drive alignment, accountability, and actionable insight across the entire organization. It includes features for scorecards, dashboards, reporting, analytics, budgeting and forecasting, among others.\n\nRemoved features\nThe following Office 2003 features were removed in Office 2007:\n Fully customizable toolbars and menus for all of its applications Quick Access Toolbar and the ribbon have limited customizability. Office 2010 reintroduced ribbon UI customizability.\n Office Assistant\n Speech recognition (included as part of Windows Vista and later)\n Handwriting recognition and ink features (included as part of Windows Vista and later)\n Ability to slipstream service packs into the original setup files (administrative installation images)\n Office Web Components\n Save My Settings Wizard\n Choice of local installation source allowing users to choose whether to keep a locally cached copy of installation source files or remove it. Setup files are now cached locally without user preference and cannot be removed. They are recreated by Office 2007 if removed.\n Several deployment-related utility Resource Kit tools. Some primary deployment tools ship with Office 2007 itself.\n Office FileSearch object and File Search functionality from File menu.\n\nCriticism\n\nRedesigned user interface\nEven though the ribbon can be hidden, PC World wrote that the new 'ribbon' interface crowds the Office work area, especially for notebook users. Others have called its large icons distracting. Essentially, the GUI-type interface of the ribbon contrasts sharply with the older menus that were organized according to the typical functions undertaken in paper-based offices: for instance, the old 'File' menu dealt with opening, (re-)naming, saving, and printing a file, and the old 'Edit' menu dealt with making changes to the content of the file. As a result, users who were more familiar with the logic of the old menus would be somewhat frustrated with the new, more visually oriented ribbon. The ribbon cannot be moved from the top to the side of the page, as floating toolbars could be.\n\nSome users with experience using previous versions of Microsoft Office have complained about having to find features in the ribbon. Others state that having learnt to use the new interface, it has improved the speed with which 'professional-looking' documents can be created. Microsoft has released a series of small programs, help sheets, videos and add-ins to help users learn the new interface more quickly.\n\nPatenting controversy\n\nMicrosoft contractor Mike Gunderloy left Microsoft partially over his disagreement with the company's 'sweeping land grab' including its attempt to patent the ribbon interface. He says 'Microsoft itself represents a grave threat to the future of software development through its increasing inclination to stifle competition through legal shenanigans.' He says that by leaving Microsoft, he is 'no longer contributing to the eventual death of programming.'\n\nOffice Open XML\nThe new XML-based document file format in Microsoft Office 2007 is incompatible with previous versions of Microsoft Office unless an add-on is installed for the older version.\n\nPC World has stated that upgrading to Office 2007 presents dangers to certain data, such as templates, macros, and mail messages.\n\nThe Microsoft Word 2007 equation editor, which uses a form of MathML called Office MathML (OMML), is also incompatible with that of Microsoft Word 2003 and previous versions. Upon converting Microsoft Word 2007 .docx files to .doc files, equations are rendered as graphics. On June 6, 2007, Inera Inc. revealed that Science and Nature refused to accept manuscripts prepared in Microsoft Word 2007 .docx format; subsequently Inera Inc. informed Microsoft that Microsoft Word 2007's file format impairs usability for scholarly publishing.  Nature still does not support Office Open XML format; Science however, accepts this format but discourages its use.\n\nBibliographies\nThe new Word 2007 features for bibliographies only support a small number of fixed citation styles. Using XSLT, new styles can be added. Some extra styles, such as the standard Association for Computing Machinery publication format, are made freely available by third parties.\n\nSee also\n Comparison of office suites\n List of office suites\n Microsoft Office 2007 filename extensions\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n2006 software\nOffice 2007\nProducts and services discontinued in 2017"},

{"id": "704742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan%20Jenkins", "title": "Stephan Jenkins", "text": "Stephan Douglas Jenkins (born September 27, 1964) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and the lead singer of the alternative rock band Third Eye Blind. Jenkins began his musical career in 1992 as part of the short-lived rap duo Puck and Natty, alongside Detroit rapper Herman Anthony Chunn. Following the breakup of the duo, Jenkins and guitarist Kevin Cadogan formed Third Eye Blind in 1993. The band released their eponymous debut studio album in 1997, which went multi-platinum in the United States. Since then, they have released five more albums: Blue (1999), Out of the Vein (2003), Ursa Major (2009), Dopamine (2015), and Screamer (2019). As part of Third Eye Blind, Jenkins has received one Billboard Music Award and eight California Music Awards.\n\nJenkins made his debut as a solo artist as a feature on Run-DMC's 2001 single 'Rock Show'. Jenkins also released a live album, Live at Amoeba, as a Record Store Day exclusive vinyl in 2016. In 2001, Jenkins made his acting debut with a cameo in the film Rock Star. Jenkins also appeared in the television series All That (2003) and Punk'd (2005), in addition to pursuing his first lead role in the 2003 thriller Art of Revenge. As a producer, Jenkins helmed the production on albums by The Braids, Vanessa Carlton, and Spencer Barnett.\n\nEarly life \n\nJenkins was born in Indio, California. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Wisconsin where his father was a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, after graduating from Northwestern University. They later moved to Palo Alto, California when Stephan was 6. When he was 7 years old, his parents divorced. His mother became an alcoholic. During elementary school, he suffered from dyslexia, causing him to repeat 1st grade. His father, who later got positions at Stanford and then the University of California, Berkeley, would help him with his dyslexia. He attended Henry M. Gunn Senior High School and graduated in 1983 where he rose to the top of his class. Jenkins got interested in music early in life. He recalls creating original musical works at the age of five using pots and pans on the floor of his kitchen at home in northern California. In 1987, he graduated from University of California, Berkeley, with a B.A. in English Literature.\n\nJenkins began musical work as a drummer. During high school, he performed with Fast Forward, consisting of Jenkins on drums, Nick Dement (guitar), Ben Austin (bass), and Greg Magel (guitar). Though the precocious Jenkins was still in high school, the other three were students at neighboring Stanford University. With the breakup of Fast Forward, Austin and Magel departed; Jenkins and Dement added new bassist Scott Lockhart and formed the trio Splash. Stanford University student Lawrence Schoeffler made a music video for their song 'Suzaie' as part of his graduate portfolio in film production, which was broadcast on MTV Basement Tapes (1983) and won a Bronze Medal at the International Film & TV Festival of New York.\n\nPuck and Natty \nJenkins then formed Puck and Natty (the name originating with the Shakespeare characters, but also serving as a playful poke at a well-known Bay Area jazz duo, Tuck & Patti), a 'funky rap masta' group, with Detroit rapper Herman Anthony Chunn in 1992. Puck and Natty was short lived; however, their track, 'Just Wanna Be Your Friend' landed on a soundtrack album of the hit TV show Beverly Hills, 90210 in 1992. In a 1999 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Jenkins provided a synopsis of the way things went down. ''You want me to do a song for your TV show that I've never seen? No problem,' recalled Jenkins. 'It was $7,800. I bought groceries.'' The duo later changed their name to Puck & Zen because of a complaint from the jazz duo, Tuck & Patti.\n\nThird Eye Blind and mainstream success \n\nJenkins formed Third Eye Blind in 1993 with Kevin Cadogan. They played small gigs around the San Francisco Bay Area for years and were, for the most part, unknown until they were signed in 1996 by Elektra Records. The band's deal with Elektra was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for a previously-unsigned artist. Jenkins has written or co-written every song on the band's five studio albums and one EP. Jenkins won two California Music Awards for Best Songwriter. along with bandmate Cadogan; in addition, he was nominated three years in a row as Best Vocalist and won Artist of the Year.\n\nOther work\n\nProducing career \nJenkins has produced for Third Eye Blind and several music artists. In 1997, he co-produced Third Eye Blind's self-titled debut studio album with Eric Valentine. The duo also helmed production on The Braids' debut studio album, Here We Come (1999). He co-produced follow-up Blue (1999) and Out of the Vein (2003) with Arion Salazar and Third Eye Blind, while acting as the sole producer on Ursa Major (2009), Dopamine (2015), and We Are Drugs (2016). In 2004, Jenkins co-wrote four songs for and produced Vanessa Carlton's second studio album, Harmonium. He co-wrote five songs for Carlton's follow-up, Heroes & Thieves (2007), in addition to co-producing the effort with Irv Gotti and Linda Perry. In 2015, Jenkins produced Spencer Barnett's extended play, 13 Summers In. In 2020, Jenkins co-wrote Blackbear's 'I Feel Bad'.\n\nActing career \nJenkins made his acting debut with a cameo in the film Rock Star (2001) playing Bradley, the lead singer of the fictional band Black Babylon. He has also appeared in the former Nickelodeon series All That, and he appeared on the MTV candid camera show Punk'd when Vanessa Carlton was the subject of one of Ashton Kutcher's practical jokes. He also starred as the lead role in the 2003 independent thriller, Art of Revenge.\n\nPersonal life \nIn 1987, Jenkins graduated as valedictorian of his class from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in English literature. Jenkins was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome preceding the release of Third Eye Blind (1997).\n\nJenkins was in a three-year relationship with actress Charlize Theron until October 2001. Some of Third Eye Blind's third album, Out of the Vein, explores the emotions Jenkins experienced as a result of their breakup. From 2002 to 2007, Jenkins dated Vanessa Carlton.\n\nWhen asked about living as a high-profile musician, he stated 'Am I a rock star? Yeah, I guess. I also get to live in North Beach and go to a pub and drink my pint and go to a café and drink my coffee. I carry groceries home on the tank of my motorcycle. I find pleasure in things that are simple. Is that a rock star's life? It is for me.'\n\nJenkins is a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. He is an advocate for gay rights, stating that he was influenced by queer culture in San Francisco. In 2016, Jenkins voiced support for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nDiscography\n\nLive albums\n\nGuest appearances\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1964 births\nLiving people\nAmerican male bloggers\nAmerican bloggers\nAmerican male singer-songwriters\nAmerican rock guitarists\nAmerican male guitarists\nAmerican rock singers\nAmerican rock songwriters\nMale actors from California\nSinger-songwriters from California\nThird Eye Blind members\nUniversity of California, Berkeley alumni\nPeople from Indio, California\nMusicians from San Bernardino, California\nPeople from Palo Alto, California\nGuitarists from California\n20th-century American guitarists\n20th-century American male musicians\nGunn High School alumni"},

He competed in the Motocross World Championships from 1983 to 1993. Thorpe is notable for being a three-time FIM 500cc motocross world champion.\n\n\nMotocross career\nThorpe's early career saw him excel in both motocross and football, and at one stage he was even offered a contract with professional side Queen's Park Rangers, before opting to concentrate on motocross. After a successful early career for the UK Kawasaki team, Thorpe switched to the Honda factory racing team in 1983. He emerged as a regular Grand Prix winner in 1984, and took his first world title in 1985. In this year's Motocross des Nations at Gaildorf in Germany he also took the overall individual win beating American riders Jeff Ward and David Bailey. He retained his world title in 1986, following a season long battle with Honda team-mate André Malherbe.\n\nA series of injuries prevented Thorpe from making a title challenge in 1987 and 1988, where he finished fifth and third respectively in the 500cc FIM World Championship. However, Thorpe won his third title in 1989, following a thrilling season-long battle with Eric Geboers. 1990 saw him move teams to the factory Kawasaki team, however the Kawasaki machine was inferior to the factory Honda, and Thorpe struggled to compete. In 1990 and 1991 he finished fifth and seventh respectively in the 500cc World Championship. Thorpe left Kawasaki in 1991, and moved back to Honda, riding for the Italian 'Cinti Honda' team. He was unable to capture his old form, and retired from professional motocross competition in 1993 at the age of 31. Thorpe remains the last British rider to have won the premier division of the motocross world championships.\n\nPost-Motocross career \nAfter his competitive career, Thorpe served as manager of the British Motocross des Nations team, which included the upset victory by the 1994 British team of Rob Herring, Paul Malin and Kurt Nicoll. The victory marked the first time a British team had won the event since 1967 and, broke a 13-year American winning streak at the Motocross des Nations. Afterwards, Thorpe concentrated on team management, running the UK based CAT Honda team during the late 1990s. The team was a success both in the UK and on the Grand Prix circuit, however Honda suddenly withdrew their support (along with several other teams) in 2001, and the team disbanded.\n\nIn recent years, Thorpe has returned to motocross, although he now competes for fun, competing in his local regional championship with great success. He has also been clerk of the course of the West of England MCC's Patchquick trophy meeting.\n\nIn 2007 Thorpe contested the two round, FIM Veterans Motocross World Cup in the senior class. Thorpe won the overall victory at both rounds (Namur, Belgium and Donington Park, Great Britain), giving him his fourth world title.\n\nReferences \n\nBritish motocross riders\nLiving people\n1960s births\nPlace of birth missing (living people)"},

He is the 2016 GP2 Series champion, and the runner-up in the 2014 Formula Renault 3.5 Series and the 2017 Super Formula Championship. He made his Formula One debut with Toro Rosso at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix. He moved to Red Bull Racing in 2019, before moving back after trading with Alexander Albon from Toro Rosso between the Hungarian and Belgian rounds to partner Daniil Kvyat. Gasly took his maiden Formula One victory at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix while driving for AlphaTauri.\n\nPersonal life \nBorn in Rouen, France, to father Jean Jacques Gasly and mother Pascale, Gasly's family has long been involved in motorsports. His grandfather competed in karting and his father Jean Jacques has also competed in various categories of racing including karting, endurance racing and rallying. Gasly is the youngest alongside his four half brothers, two maternal from his mother's previous marriage; Nicolas Caron and Cyril Caron, as well as two paternal from his father's previous marriage; Phillipe Gasly and Paul Gasly. At the age of six, Gasly first experienced karting at a local karting track in Anneville-Ambourville. Gasly grew up alongside the late Anthoine Hubert; karting with him since the age of seven, being educated at the same private school and having resided together as roommates for several years. He was also friends with Charles Leclerc since a young age and Esteban Ocon during the early stages of his karting career. In 2019 he moved to Milan. Besides his native French, Gasly also speaks Italian and English.\n\nCareer\n\nKarting\nGasly entered competitive karting in 2006 at the age of ten, when he finished fifteenth in the French Minime Championship, before he finished fourth the following year. In 2008 he stepped up to the French Cadet Championship, before moving to the international scene in 2009. He moved into the KF3 category, staying until the end of 2010, when he finished as runner-up in the CIK-FIA European Championship.\n\nFormula Renault\n\nIn 2011, Gasly made his début in single-seaters, taking part in the French F4 Championship 1.6-litre category. He finished third behind his future Eurocup rivals Matthieu Vaxivière and Andrea Pizzitola with seven podiums, including wins at Spa, Albi and Le Castellet.\n\nGasly moved to the 2-litre Formula Renault machinery in 2012, joining R-Ace GP in the Formula Renault Eurocup. He finished tenth with six point-scoring finishes, including podiums at Spa and the Nürburgring. He also had seven starts in the Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup with the same team, taking a podium at the Nürburgring.\n\nFor 2013, Gasly moved to Tech 1 Racing. He took five podiums, as well as victories at Moscow, the Hungaroring and Le Castellet. He held an eleven-point lead over Oliver Rowland into the final meeting at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, and ultimately clinched the title with third and sixth-place finishes; the latter result coming after a collision with Rowland, who received a drive-through penalty as a result.\n\nThe driver jumped to Formula Renault 3.5 Series in 2014, where he was hired by Arden under the Red Bull Junior Team development program. He finished the season as runner-up to another Red Bull Junior Carlos Sainz Jr., collecting eight podiums in the seventeen races.\n\nGP2 Series\n\nGasly made his GP2 Series debut in 2014 at Monza circuit in support of Italian Grand Prix, replacing Caterham Racing driver Tom Dillmann who had commitments at other racing series and was unable to participate in GP2 Series races for that weekend. He then partook in post-season testing, driving for DAMS and signed with the French team to race alongside the British driver Alex Lynn, development driver of Williams F1 Team. Though taking three pole positions and four podiums, Gasly experienced an uneven season, including causing collisions in Bahrain, Spa and Yas Marina (which got the subsequent race cancelled), which saw him finish eighth, two places behind teammate Lynn.\n\nGasly would switch to newcomers Prema Powerteam alongside 2015 European Formula 3 runner-up and GP2 rookie Antonio Giovinazzi for 2016. He would go on to become the GP2 Series champion that season.\n\nJapanese Super Formula\n\nGasly joined Team Mugen to drive a Red Bull-sponsored Honda at the 2017 Super Formula Championship, winning two races, and almost winning the championship by half a point.\n\nFormula E \n\nGasly made a one-off Formula E appearance for Renault  where he replaced Sébastien Buemi for the 2017 New York ePrix, due to the latter's commitments to the World Endurance Championship. In the weekend's first race, Gasly recovered from the poor qualifying performance of 19th to finish seventh in his debut race. Gasly nearly finished on the podium in the second race, hitting the wall on the exit of the final corner while battling for third and limping across the finish line with major damage in fourth.\n\nFormula One\nIn December 2013 it was announced that Gasly would be inducted into the Red Bull Junior Team for the 2014 Formula One season alongside future GP2 Series teammate Alex Lynn and future Scuderia Toro Rosso teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. Gasly's first experience in Formula One machinery came in May 2015 at the in-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. He drove the Toro Rosso STR10 on the first day of the test and the Red Bull RB11 on the second day, recording 203 laps in total. He later tested the RB11 again at the Red Bull Ring in June and was officially named Red Bull Racing's reserve driver in September. Gasly continued testing for Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso during the  and  seasons.\n\nToro Rosso (2017–2018) \n Gasly made his Formula One race debut at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix with Scuderia Toro Rosso, replacing Daniil Kvyat. He finished the Malaysian and Japanese Grands Prix outside the points. Gasly was expected to take Carlos Sainz Jr.'s seat at Austin but he was forced to miss the race due to a clash with the final round of the 2017 Super Formula Championship. He returned to the team for the , partnering with Brendon Hartley after the team decided to drop Kvyat from the Red Bull programme.\n\nGasly and Hartley became full-time Toro Rosso drivers for the  season. At the , Gasly qualified sixth but was promoted to fifth after Lewis Hamilton's penalty. He eventually finished the race in fourth place, earning his first points finish in Formula One. A week later at the , he crashed into teammate Hartley in what the two confessed as being a 'miscommunication'. Gasly recorded four more points finishes during the season, including seventh place at the  and sixth place at the . He ended the season in 15th place in the championship with 29 points, comfortably ahead of Hartley's total of four points.\n\nRed Bull (2019) \n\nGasly was contracted to drive for Red Bull Racing for the  season, partnering Max Verstappen following the departure of Daniel Ricciardo to Renault. Gasly struggled with the RB15 and was consistently off Verstappen's pace. He finished a lap behind Verstappen at several races and only out-qualified Verstappen on one occasion, the , when Verstappen was hampered by a red flag in qualifying. At both the Chinese and Monaco Grands Prix, Gasly recorded the fastest lap of the race. His best result with Red Bull Racing came at the  where he finished fourth after Verstappen and Sebastian Vettel collided ahead.\n\nGasly came under increasing pressure at the , where he was lapped by Verstappen during a race in which he could have assisted Verstappen from being passed by Lewis Hamilton for the race win, had he been close enough behind. Despite Gasly's poor form, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner stated that the team intended to keep Gasly until the end of the season. By the summer break, Gasly was in sixth place in the championship with 63 points, five points ahead of Carlos Sainz Jr. in the inferior McLaren. Verstappen, meanwhile, had recorded 181 points, two race wins, five podium finishes, and one pole position.\n\nReturn to Toro Rosso (2019)\n\nAhead of the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix, Gasly was demoted back to junior team Toro Rosso with Alex Albon taking his place. Upon the shock mid-season announcement, Red Bull said in a press release, “The team will use the next nine races to evaluate Alex’s performance to make an informed decision as to who will drive alongside Max in 2020.” On the dropping of Gasly, Christian Horner said: 'Pierre really needs to take some time out during the break, reflect, and take the lessons into the second part of the year. We desperately need him realising more of the potential of the car.'\n\nDuring the remainder of the season at Toro Rosso, partnering with Daniil Kvyat, Gasly achieved five points finishes, including a ninth-place at his first race back at the team in Belgium. His best result came at the chaotic . Gasly qualified in seventh place and took advantage of retirements from Valtteri Bottas and both Ferrari drivers, as well as a collision between Lewis Hamilton and Alex Albon, to finish the race in second place after holding off Hamilton in a straight drag to the finish line. This marked the first podium finish of Gasly's Formula One career, Toro Rosso's best race result since the 2008 Italian Grand Prix, and Honda's first 1–2 finish since the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix. On his cool-down lap, Gasly remarked over the radio: 'This is the best day of my life'. He ended the season in seventh place in the championship with 95 points.\n\nAlphaTauri (2020–) \n\nGasly was retained by the team, along with Kvyat, as they rebranded to Scuderia AlphaTauri. Gasly achieved four points finishes in the first seven races of the season, with best results of seventh place at the Austrian and British Grands Prix.\n\nAt the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, an early pit stop allowed Gasly to pass several drivers - who had to wait for the pitlane to open during a safety car procedure - and go up to a net third place. As race leader Hamilton entered the pits to serve a penalty and second-placed driver Lance Stroll lost places at the restart, Gasly inherited the lead of the race and held off the late-charging Carlos Sainz Jr. to take his first win in Formula One, becoming the 109th different race winner and the first French driver to win a Grand Prix since Olivier Panis' victory at the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix, 24 years prior.\n\nThis prompted speculation that Gasly could return to Red Bull, as his replacement at the team, Alex Albon, finished only 15th. Gasly remarked that he was 'ready' to do so. AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost praised Gasly's race but dismissed the possibility of Gasly returning to Red Bull soon. He finished the 2020 season 10th in the championship with 75 points, ahead of teammate Kvyat on 32 points.\n\n2021 \n\nGasly was retained by AlphaTauri for , partnered by Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda. At the , Gasly took his third career podium after a battle with Charles Leclerc and Lando Norris for third place on the final lap. Originally starting fourth, Gasly dropped to fifth place early in the race but benefitted from a tyre failure for Max Verstappen and a mistake from Lewis Hamilton in the closing stages. At the 2021 Italian Grand Prix, Gasly crashed out in the sprint after his front wing got wedged underneath his wheels. He retired from the Grand Prix on lap 4 due to damaged suspension.\n\n2022 \nGasly will continue to race for AlphaTauri in  alongside Tsunoda.\n\nKarting record\n\nKarting career summary\n\nRacing record\n\nRacing career summary\n\nComplete Formula Renault 3.5 Series results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete GP2 Series results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete Super Formula results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete Formula One results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicates fastest lap)\n\n Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.\n Half points awarded as less than 75% of race distance was completed.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n  \n \n\n1996 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Rouen\nFrench racing drivers\nFrench F4 Championship drivers\nFormula One race winners\nFormula Renault 2.0 NEC drivers\nFormula Renault Eurocup drivers\nFormula Renault 2.0 Alps drivers\nWorld Series Formula V8 3.5 drivers\nGP2 Series drivers\nGP2 Series Champions\nSuper Formula drivers\nFormula E drivers\nFrench Formula One drivers\nToro Rosso Formula One drivers\nRed Bull Formula One drivers\nAlphaTauri Formula One drivers\nTwitch (service) streamers\nR-ace GP drivers\nTech 1 Racing drivers\nArden International drivers\nDAMS drivers\nPrema Powerteam drivers\nMugen Motorsports drivers"},

{"id": "35060755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjernevask", "title": "Hjernevask", "text": "Hjernevask ('Brainwash') is a Norwegian documentary miniseries about science that aired on NRK1 in 2010. The series, consisting of seven episodes, was created for NRK and presented by the comedian and sociologist Harald Eia.\n\nThe series contrasted cultural determinist models of human behavior (also referred to as the Standard social science model) with nature-nurture interactionist perspectives. In support of the cultural determinist perspective it interviewed mainly Norwegian humanities scholars, in particular literary theorist Jørgen Lorentzen at the Centre for Gender Research. Experts interviewed for the series in support of a nature-nurture interactionist perspective included Simon Baron-Cohen, Steven Pinker, Simon LeVay, David Buss, Glenn Wilson, Robert Plomin and Anne Campbell. This ignited a wide public discussion on the subject of the nature versus nurture debate, and especially focused on the views expressed by Lorentzen. The entire series has since been released online.\n\nObjectives and awards\nEia and coproducer Ole Martin Ihle have named Steven Pinker's book The Blank Slate as an inspiration for the documentary series. The series was a huge success, and Eia was awarded the Fritt Ord Award for 'having precipitated one of the most heated debates on research in recent times'.\n\nEpisodes \nThe producers have made the series available online. Episodes linked in the external links have English subtitles available.\n\nReception\n\nHjernevask led to extensive public debate, largely focused on the views expressed in the program by literary scholar Jørgen Lorentzen at the Centre for Gender Research. Lorentzen's description of the research of psychologists Simon Baron-Cohen, Anne Campbell and Richard Lippa as 'weak science' was strongly criticized by many commentators; biologist Trond Amundsen pointed out that Lorentzen's work was cited less than 30 times in academic literature and responded that 'the characteristic 'weak science' would be rude and uncollegial if Lorentzen was a leading international expert and the three researchers were in fact not so meritorious. But all three are meritorious international researchers [...] against this background, the statement is just embarrassing.'\n\nLorentzen accused his critics including 'Ottar Brox, , Stig Frøland, , Tor K. Larsen and others' of being 'cowardly hyenas' who have shown 'neither insight into nor interest in gender research.' Lorentzen also accused series creator Eia of being motivated by a midlife crisis. Eia pointed out that Lorentzen has a very limited scholarly impact with few international publications and a very low number of citations, and said that he wouldn’t have interviewed Lorentzen for the series if he had known at the time that Lorentzen was 'such a low-level researcher.' Jon Hustad accused Lorentzen of being 'blinded by ideology.' In response to claims by Lorentzen that NRK had portrayed him unfairly and misrepresented his comments, NRK made all the raw footage available. Lorentzen complained to the Norwegian Press Complaints Commission (PFU). In June 2010 PFU concluded that NRK had not violated press ethics or portrayed Lorentzen in an unfair manner; the chairman of PFU described Hjernevask as a 'solid work' of investigative journalism. Eia received the 2010 Fritt Ord Honorary Award for the series.\n\nSeveral years after Hjernevask aired, it was reported that it has been used in Eastern Europe to promote false claims that all gender studies research in Norway has been closed down in its aftermath; Harald Eia commented that he did not make Hjernevask for a Hungarian audience, and that he wanted to showcase the arrogance he felt Lorentzen displayed towards other research fields for a Norwegian audience.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nIMDb\nInternet Archive playlist\nDailyMotion playlist\nYouTube playlist\n\n2010 Norwegian television series debuts\nNorwegian documentary television series\nNRK original programming\nDocumentary films about science\nNature educational television series\nScience education television series\nDocumentary television series about science\nDocumentary films about race and ethnicity\nSexual orientation and science\nSociobiology\nEvolutionary psychology\nEvolutionary biology\n2010s Norwegian television series\n2010 Norwegian television series endings\nRace and intelligence controversy"},

He was also a member of the team that won the silver medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta.\n\nSingh was a recipient of the Indian government's Arjuna Award in 1963 and the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honor, in 1964.\n\nEarly life \nSingh was born on 3 February 1931 in Mairi Village in the Amb subdivision of Una district in present day Himachal Pradesh (then Punjab, British Raj). Charanjit Singh was an alumnus of Col. Brown Cambridge School, Dehradun and was exposed to hockey during his time there. Singh graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the Government Agricultural College, Lyallpur (in modern-day Pakistan). During this time, he represented Panjab University.\n\nCareer \nSingh started his career representing Punjab Police and was picked for the Indian team in the early 1950s, playing as a midfielder (also referred to as center-half) in a team that included Leslie Claudius, Keshav Dutt, and Joseph Antic, all playing in the midfield position.\n\nSingh was the captain of the Indian hockey team that won the gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. He was also a member of the team that won the silver medal at the Field hockey at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He also represented India in two Asian Games, including the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta. He is credited with returning the gold medal to the Indian team in 1964, when earlier in both the 1962 Asian games and in the 1960 Olympics, the country had lost in the finals to Pakistan. Singh had missed the final against Pakistan due to an injury. In 1964, under Singh's captaincy, the Indian team won a few tournaments leading up to the Olympics, and remained unbeaten in the Olympics, winning seven matches and drawing two, before defeating Australia 3-1 in the semifinals, and Pakistan, 1-0 in the finals. In an editorial, the Indian newspaper, The Indian Express, called Singh's style of play 'crafty' and him a 'member of the golden generation', referring to him and some of his peers including Balbir Singh Dosanjh, Keshav Dutt, and Balbir Singh Junior. The newspaper went on to note that he would be 'remembered as one of the key men responsible for India regaining its supremacy on the hockey field'.\n\nHe was a recipient of the Arjuna Award in 1963 and the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honor, in 1964. \n\nAfter his retirement from the sport, he served as the dean of student welfare at Punjab Agricultural University and later at the Hisar Agricultural University, before going on to become the director of sports at Himachal Pradesh University.\n\nPersonal life \nSingh was married and had two sons and a daughter. Singh died from a heart attack at his home in Una, Himachal Pradesh, on 27 January 2022, seven days before his 91st birthday. He had suffered a paralytic attack five years before his death.

{"id": "2976939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith%20Beheading%20Holofernes%20%28Caravaggio%29", "title": "Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)", "text": "Judith Beheading Holofernes is a painting of the biblical episode by Caravaggio, painted in , in which the widow Judith stayed with the Assyrian general Holofernes in his tent after a banquet then decapitated him after he passed out drunk. The painting was rediscovered in 1950 and is part of the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome. The exhibition 'Dentro Caravaggio' Palazzo Reale, Milan (Sept 2017-Jan 2018), suggests a date of 1602 on account of the use of light underlying sketches not seen in Caravaggio's early work but characteristic of his later works. The exhibition catalogue (Skira, 2018, p88) also cites biographer artist Giovanni Baglione's account that the work was commissioned by Genoa banker Ottavio Costa.\n\nA second painting on the exact same subject (see below) and dated to 1607, attributed by several experts to Caravaggio but still disputed by others, was rediscovered by chance in 2014 and went on sale in June 2019 as 'Judith and Holofernes'.\n\nSubject \n\nThe deuterocanonical Book of Judith tells how Judith served her people by seducing and pleasuring Holofernes, the Syrian General. Judith gets Holofernes drunk, then seizes her sword and slays him: 'Approaching to his bed, she took hold of the hair of his head' ().\n\nCaravaggio's approach was, typically, to choose the moment of greatest dramatic impact: the moment of decapitation itself. The figures are set out in a shallow stage, theatrically lit from the side, isolated against the inky black background. Judith's maid Abra stands beside her mistress to the right as Judith extends her arm to hold a blade  against Holofernes's neck; lying on his stomach, neck contorted as he turns his head towards his assassin, he is vulnerable. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio adjusted the placement of Holofernes' head as he proceeded, separating it slightly from the torso and moving it minutely to the right. The faces of the three characters demonstrate the artist's mastery of emotion, Judith's countenance in particular showing a mix of determination and repulsion. Artemisia Gentileschi and others were deeply influenced by this work; while they even surpassed Caravaggio's physical realism, it has been argued that none matched his capture of Judith's psychological ambivalence.\n\nThe model for Judith is probably the Roman courtesan Fillide Melandroni, who posed for several other works by Caravaggio around this year; the scene itself, especially the details of blood and decapitation, were presumably drawn from his observations of the public execution of Beatrice Cenci in 1599.\n\nPossible second version\n\nWhen Caravaggio left Naples on 14 June 1607, he left two paintings - the Madonna of the Rosary and Judith beheading Holofernes - in the studio in Naples that was shared by the two Flemish painters and art dealers Louis Finson and Abraham Vinck. Vinck likely took the two paintings with him when he left Naples and settled in Amsterdam around 1609.  Later Finson also moved to Amsterdam. The two paintings are mentioned again, this time in the will and testament dated 19 September 1617 prepared by Finson in Amsterdam.  In his will Finson left Vinck his share in the two Caravaggio paintings that they had owned in common since Naples. Finson died shortly after making his will and his heir Vinck died two years later.  After Vinck died his heirs sold the Madonna of the Rosary after 1619 for 1800 florins to a committee of Flemish painters and 'amateurs' led by Peter Paul Rubens for the Saint Paul's Church of the Dominican friars in Antwerp.  In 1786, Emperor Joseph II of Austria first ordered the closure of all 'useless' monastic orders and then claimed the other painting by Caravaggio for his art collection.  It can now be admired in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.  Caravaggio's work, which was a gift of Antwerp's leading artists and an expression of their deep religious devotion had thus become the object of looting by the Austrian rulers of Flanders.\n\nThere was no trace of the second Caravaggio representing Judith beheading Holofernes co-owned by Vinck and Finson since the early 1600s. It was suggested that it should be identified with the painting in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank in Naples.\nA painting of Judith beheading Holofernes discovered in an attic in Toulouse in 2014 is believed by certain scholars to be the lost Caravaggio.  Other scholars see in both the Toulouse Judith and the work in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank not only works painted by the hand of Finson but they have also contended that they are in fact original creations of Finson rather than copies after a lost Caravaggio. The Toulouse version has even been described as Finson's masterpiece.  Both camps of art historians base their attribution on the stylistic and technical features of the work.\n\nAn export ban was placed on the painting by the French government while tests were carried out to establish its authenticity.  In February 2019 it was announced that the painting would be sold at auction after the Louvre had turned down the opportunity to purchase it for €100 million. It was instead bought by art collector and hedge fund manager J.Tomilson Hill for an undisclosed amount of money shortly before the planned auction, in June 2019. The new owner is a board member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nExternal links\n \n Caravaggio.org - Analysis of Caravaggio's 'Judith Beheading Holofernes'\n\nReferences \n\n1590s paintings\nPaintings by Caravaggio\nCollections of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica\nPaintings about death\nPaintings depicting Judith\nChristian art about death\n\npt:Judite e Holoferne"},

Its home matches are played at the Ridley Athletic Complex. Charley Toomey has served as its head coach since 2006. It became a member of the Patriot League along with the university's other intercollegiate athletic programs on July 1, 2013. The Greyhounds were a member of the ECAC Lacrosse League from 2005 to 2013. It became the first member of the conference to win a national championship in 2012. It was also the first national title in the university's Division I history.\n\nLoyola, a Jesuit university with over 3,700 undergraduates, has produced 13 USILA First Team All-Americans, 25 Second Team All-Americans, 18 Third Team All-Americans, and 68 Honorable Mention All-Americans. The Greyhounds local rivals are the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, located just down Charles Street. The annual lacrosse game played between these two institutions is known as the 'Battle of Charles Street'. The program also has another significant rival in Baltimore, maintaining an annual series with the Towson Tigers since 1959.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginnings\nThe Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse team was founded in 1938 and coached by Jack Kelly. Kelly coached five seasons before leaving after 1942, with an overall winning record consisting of 21 wins and 14 losses. The Greyhounds struggled after Kelly left, going through two coaches in two seasons, both of which did not break .250. In 1947 began the reign of the program's longest active coach until that time, Bishop Baker. Baker coached for six consecutive seasons, almost breaking even with wins and losses. He was followed by John Mohler, who only coached for one year.\n\nCharles Wenzel\nFor 17 seasons, from 1954 to 1970, the Greyhounds were coached by Charles Wenzel. Under Wenzel, the Greyhounds went .379.\n\nDave Cottle\n From 1983 to 2001, for almost two decades under Head Coach Dave Cottle, Loyola saw growth in to their lacrosse program. In 1982, Loyola moved up from NCAA Division II lacrosse. Starting in 1983, Cottle brought the Greyhounds national attention.  The Greyhounds advanced to the 1990 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship game where they were defeated by the Syracuse Orangemen. The 1990 championship, however, was revoked from Syracuse when investigations deemed the activity between coach Roy Simmons, Jr.'s wife Nancy and star player Paul Gait illegal. She signed the lease of his car earlier that season. Though the NCAA has yet to remove Syracuse from the record book, Loyola was the runner up and technically is the next in line for the trophy.\nIn 1999, the Greyhounds went undefeated in the regular season before losing in the quarterfinals of the 1999 NCAA tournament. His run lasted 19 seasons, beginning in 1983 through 2001, Cottle coached his teams to a winning record of 181 wins and 70 losses, including a run of 14 straight seasons where Loyola received an NCAA tournament bid.\n\nCharley Toomey\nFollowing Cottle's  long coaching tenure, Loyola hired Bill Dirrigl as their head coach.  After four seasons Dirrigl was fired and Loyola graduate Charley Toomey took over as head coach in 2006.  In both 2007 and 2008, Toomey led the Greyhounds to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament. The 2010 and 2011 NCAA lacrosse championships were held at M&T Bank Stadium. Loyola, worked in conjunction with Johns Hopkins, Towson, and UMBC to run these events. The Hounds failed to advance to the 2009 NCAA lacrosse playoffs despite having the ninth place RPI, the third highest strength of schedule, and a 9-5 record. Instead Brown gained the slot because of their wins over Cornell and University of Massachusetts. Brown had an RPI of twelve, their schedule ranked a low of thirty six, and were ranked third in the Ivy League. Coach Toomey compared the 2009 Greyhound's dilemma to that of the 2006 Harvard squad saying, 'I can remember in 2006, Harvard gets in at 6-6, losing their last three games, and they said, ‘It’s not a numbers thing, it’s a strength-of-schedule thing.’ … So what is it going to be? Is it going to be big wins or numbers? If it’s numbers, we look doggone good. If it’s about big wins, then we might be on the outside looking in.' Harvard made the tournament over Toomey's squad that season, the reason being that their 'big wins' were not as competitive as Harvard's record, RPI and SOS. RPI vs. Big wins has been a very large argument in the NCAA tournament selection process the past few years.\n\nThe Greyhounds captured the first national championship in Loyola's Division I history in a 9–3 victory over Maryland at Gillette Stadium on May 28, 2012. They finished at 18–1, establishing a new program record for most wins in a campaign. Its only loss was a regular-season-ending 10–9 overtime defeat at home to Johns Hopkins on April 28. The team was led by attackers Eric Lusby and Mike Sawyer. Lusby was named the Championship's Most Outstanding Player after scoring four times in the Final and whose 17 goals were the most in a single NCAA tournament. He also set the school record for most goals in a single season with 54. Sawyer, who had previously set the school's new single-season scoring mark earlier in the season, was Loyola's first-ever Tewaaraton Trophy finalist.\n\nSeason Results\nThe following is a list of Loyola’s season results since the institution of NCAA Division I in 1971 (Loyola competed in NCAA Division II until 1983):\n\n{| class='wikitable'\n\n|- align='center'\n\n†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus.\n\nPlayers\nThe Greyhounds have graduated many All-American players: 13 first team, 25 second team, 18 third team, and 68 honorable mentions.

In an apparently short and uneventful career, she made five voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) before she was broken up in 1823.\n\nCareer\nOn 12 July 1809, Messrs. Anderson and Swan, sole owners of Lady Carrington, offered her services to the EIC. The government had already chartered her to carry troops and stores to the Cape of Good Hope. Anderson and Swan proposed to send her from the Cape to Bengal to bring back cargo for the EIC at a rate of £16 6s per ton. The EIC requested some upgrading of Lady Carrington and accepted the offer.\n\nLady Carrington appeared in the 1810 volumes of Lloyd's Register (LR) and the Register of Shipping (RS) with somewhat jumbled and inconsistent information. Lloyd's Register showed her master as W. Atkins, changing to J. Sayton, her owner as Campbell, changing to Anderson & Co., and her trade London–Cape of Good Hope. The Register of Shipping, published slightly later, showed her master as W. Atkins, her owner as Swan, and her trade as London–Bengal.\n\n1st EIC voyage (1809–1810): Captain Walter Atkins acquired a letter of marque on 14 July 1809. He sailed from the Downs, bound for Bengal and Madras. Lady Carrington reached the  Cape of Good Hope on 17 January 1810 and arrived at Calutta on 28 March. Homeward bound, she was at Culpee (on the Hooghly River on 5 June and reached Madras on 10 July. From there she reached St Helena on 30 September and arrived back at the Downs on 5 December. \n\nIn 1811 Lady Carrington underwent some repairs and lengthening.\n\n2nd EIC voyage (1812–1813): Captain William Hawkey acquired a letter of marque on 30 January 1812. He sailed from Portsmouth on 10 March 1812, bound for Bombay and Bengal. Lady Carrington reached Bombay on 11 Jul, Madras on 24 August, and Balasore on 20 September; she arrived at Calcutta on 26 October. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 27 January 1813, and Madras again on 15 March. She reached St Helena on 30 July and arrived at the Downs on 7 November. \n\n3rd EIC voyage (1814–1815): Captain Henry Becher sailed from Portsmouth on 8 June 1814, bound for Bengal. Lady Carrington was at Madeira on 23 June and Mauritius on 15 October, and arrived at Kidderpore on 8 January 1815. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 17 March. She stopped at Bencoolen on 25 June and Mauritius on 16 August. She reached the Cape on 26 September and St Helena on 14 October, and arrived at the Downs on 22 December.\n\n4th EIC voyage (1816–1817): Captain Dugald MacDougall sailed from the Downs on 17 May 1816, bound for Bengal. Lady Carrington was at Madeira on 29 May and arrived at Calcutta on 8 October. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 22 February 1817, reached St Helena on 29 May, and arrived at the Downs on 30 July. \n\nIn 1818–1819 Lady Carrington did not sail for the EIC. She sailed to St Helena, the Cape, and Bengal under a license from the EIC, but not under the EIC's auspices. A list of licensed ships shows Lady Carrington, A.J. Moore, master, J. Campbell, ship's husband, sailing for Bengal on 20 January 1818.\n\n5th EIC voyage (1820–1821): Captain Thomas Erasmus Ward sailed from the Downs on 4 May 1820, bound for Madras and Bengal. Lady Carrington reached Madras on 14 September and arrived at Kidderpore on 7 November. Homeward bound, she was at Saugor on 11 January, reaching Maulipatam on 28 February and Madras on 9 March.

{"id": "18949154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine%20Wall", "title": "Antonine Wall", "text": "The Antonine Wall, known to the Romans as Vallum Antonini, was a turf fortification on stone foundations, built by the Romans across what is now the Central Belt of Scotland, between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. Built some twenty years after Hadrian's Wall to the south, and intended to supersede it, while it was garrisoned it was the northernmost frontier barrier of the Roman Empire. It spanned approximately  and was about  high and  wide. Lidar scans have been carried out to establish the length of the wall and the Roman distance units used. Security was bolstered by a deep ditch on the northern side. It is thought that there was a wooden palisade on top of the turf. The barrier was the second of two 'great walls' created by the Romans in Great Britain in the second century CE. Its ruins are less evident than those of the better-known and longer Hadrian's Wall to the south, primarily because the turf and wood wall has largely weathered away, unlike its stone-built southern predecessor.\n\nConstruction began in 142 CE at the order of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, and took about 12 years to complete. Antoninus Pius never visited Britain, whereas his predecessor Hadrian had done so. Pressure from the Caledonians may have led Antoninus to send the empire's troops further north. The Antonine Wall was protected by 16 forts with small fortlets between them; troop movement was facilitated by a road linking all the sites known as the Military Way. The soldiers who built the wall commemorated the construction and their struggles with the Caledonians with decorative slabs, twenty of which survive. The wall was abandoned only eight years after completion, and the garrisons relocated rearward to Hadrian's Wall. Most of the wall and its associated fortifications have been destroyed over time, but some remains are visible. Many of these have come under the care of Historic Environment Scotland and the UNESCO World Heritage Committee.\n\nLocation and construction \n\nRoman Emperor Antoninus Pius ordered the construction of the Antonine Wall around 142 CE. Quintus Lollius Urbicus, governor of Roman Britain at the time, initially supervised the effort, which took about twelve years to complete. The wall stretches  from Old Kilpatrick in West Dunbartonshire on the Firth of Clyde to Carriden near Bo'ness on the Firth of Forth. The wall was intended to extend Roman territory and dominance by replacing Hadrian's Wall  to the south, as the frontier of Britannia. But while the Romans did establish forts and temporary camps further north of the Antonine Wall in order to protect their routes to the north of Scotland, they did not conquer the Caledonians, and the Antonine Wall suffered many attacks. The Romans called the land north of the wall Caledonia, though in some contexts the term may refer to the whole area north of Hadrian's Wall. The land north of the Antonine Wall also ended up becoming the part of Scotland known as Albany.\n\nThe Antonine Wall was shorter than Hadrian's Wall and built of turf on a stone foundation, but it was still an impressive achievement. It was also a simpler fortification than Hadrian's Wall insofar as it did not have a subsidiary ditch system behind it to the south, as Hadrian's Wall did with its Vallum. The stone foundations and wing walls of the original forts on the Antonine Wall demonstrate that the original plan was to build a stone wall similar to Hadrian's Wall, but this was quickly amended. As built, the wall was typically a bank, about  high, made of layered turves and occasionally earth with a wide ditch on the north side, and a military way on the south. The Romans initially planned to build forts every , but this was soon revised to every , resulting in a total of nineteen forts along the wall. The best preserved but also one of the smallest forts is Rough Castle Fort. In addition to the forts, there are at least 9 smaller fortlets, very likely on Roman mile spacings, which formed part of the original scheme, some of which were later replaced by forts. The most visible fortlet is Kinneil, at the eastern end of the Wall, near Bo'ness.\n\nThere was once a remarkable Roman structure within sight of the Antonine Wall at Stenhousemuir, which took its name from the Roman 'stone house'. This was Arthur's O'on, a circular stone domed monument or rotunda, which may have been a temple, or a tropaeum, a victory monument. It was demolished for its stone in 1743, though a replica exists at Penicuik House.\n\nIn addition to the line of the Wall itself there are a number of coastal forts both in the East (e.g. Inveresk) and West (Outerwards and Lurg Moor), which should be considered as outposts and/or supply bases to the Wall itself. In addition a number of forts farther north were brought back into service in the Gask Ridge area, including Ardoch, Strageath, Bertha (Perth) and probably Dalginross and Cargill.\n\nRecent research by Glasgow University has shown that the distance stones, stone sculptures unique to the Antonine Wall which were embedded in the wall to mark the lengths built by each legion, were brightly painted unlike their present bare appearance. These stones are preserved in the University's museum and are said to be the best-preserved examples of statuary from any Roman frontier. Several of the slabs have been analysed by various techniques including portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF). Tiny remnants of paint have been detected by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Several of the distance slabs have been scanned and 3-D videos produced. There are plans to reproduce the slabs, both digitally and in real physical copies, with their authentic colours. A copy of the Bridgeness Slab has already been made and can be found in Bo'ness. It is also expected that lottery funding will allow replicas of distance markers to be placed along the length of the wall.\n\nAbandonment \nThe wall was abandoned only eight years after completion, when the Roman legions withdrew to Hadrian's Wall in 162 CE, and over time may have reached an accommodation with the Brythonic tribes of the area, whom they may have fostered as possible buffer states which would later become 'The Old North'. After a series of attacks in 197, the emperor Septimius Severus arrived in Scotland in 208, and campaigned against the Maeatae (based in the central Midland Valley either side of the Clyde – Firth of Forth line) and the Caledonians to their north. While he carried out substantial work on Hadrian's Wall at this time, there is no evidence of any attention being paid to the remains of the Antonine Wall during the campaigns of 208-210. References in Late Roman sources to Severus' wall-building activities led to later scholars like Bede mistaking references to the Antonine Wall for ones to Hadrian's Wall.\n\nPost-Roman history \nIn the centuries since the Antonine Wall lay abandoned it had an influence over culture between the Forth and the Clyde.\n\nGildas and Bede \n\nWriting in 730 CE, Bede, following Gildas in his De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, mistakenly ascribes the construction of the Antonine Wall to the Britons in his Historia Ecclesiastica 1.12:\n\nBede associated Gildas's turf wall with the Antonine Wall. As for Hadrian's Wall, Bede again follows Gildas:\n\nBede obviously identified Gildas's stone wall as Hadrian's Wall, but he sets its construction in the 5th century rather than the 120s, and does not mention Hadrian. And he would appear to have believed that the ditch-and-mound barrier known as the Vallum (just to the south of, and contemporary with, Hadrian's Wall) was the rampart constructed by Severus. Many centuries would pass before just who built what became apparent.\n\nGrim's Dyke \nIn medieval histories, such as the chronicles of John of Fordun, the wall is called Gryme's dyke. Fordun says that the name came from the grandfather of the imaginary king Eugenius son of Farquahar. This evolved over time into Graham's dyke – a name still found in Bo'ness at the wall's eastern end – and then linked with Clan Graham. Of note is that Graeme in some parts of Scotland is a nickname for the devil, and Gryme's Dyke would thus be the Devil's Dyke, mirroring the name of the Roman limes in Southern Germany often called 'Teufelsmauer'. Grímr and Grim are bynames for Odin or Wodan, who might be credited with the wish to build earthworks in unreasonably short periods of time. This name is the same one found as Grim's Ditch several times in England in connection with early ramparts: for example, near Wallingford, Oxfordshire or between Berkhamsted (Herts) and Bradenham (Bucks). Other names used by antiquarians include the Wall of Pius and the Antonine Vallum, after Antoninus Pius. Hector Boece in his 1527 History of Scotland called it the 'wall of Abercorn', repeating the story that it had been destroyed by Graham.\n\nWorld Heritage status \n\nThe UK government's nomination of the Antonine Wall for World Heritage status to the international conservation body UNESCO was first officially announced in 2003. It has been backed by the Scottish Government since 2005 and by Scotland's then Culture Minister Patricia Ferguson since 2006.  It became the UK's official nomination in late January 2007, and MSPs were called to support the bid anew in May 2007. The Antonine Wall was listed as an extension to the World Heritage Site 'Frontiers of the Roman Empire' on 7 July 2008. Though the Antonine Wall is mentioned in the text, it does not appear on UNESCO's map of world heritage properties.\n\nHistoric Environment Scotland \nSeveral individual sites along the line of the wall are in the care of Historic Scotland. These are at:\n\n Bar Hill Fort\n Bearsden Bath House\n Castlecary\n Croy Hill\n Dullatur\n Rough Castle\n Seabegs Wood\n Watling Lodge\n Westerwood, Cumbernauld\n\nAll sites are unmanned and open at all reasonable times.\n\nMapping the wall \nThe first capable effort to systematically map the Antonine Wall was undertaken in 1764 by William Roy, the forerunner of the Ordnance Survey. He provided accurate and detailed drawings of its remains, and where the wall has been destroyed by later development, his maps and drawings are now the only reliable record of it. In the 19th century, the Ordnance Survey showed the visible traces of the wall in some detail on its first and second edition maps at 25-inch and 6-inch scales, but no attempt was made at that date to undertake archaeological work.\n\nSir George Macdonald carried out systematic work on the wall that was published in 1911 and in an expanded second edition in 1934. His work provided the basis for a large-scale (25-inch) folio produced by the Ordnance Survey in 1931. The Ordnance Survey produced a revised folio in 1954–1957, and then carried out a complete re-survey in 1979–80. They also published a smaller scale map of the Wall, at 1:25,000 in 1969. Further mapping activity was carried out to support the nomination of the Wall as a World Heritage Site\n\nModern computer techniques like using GIS and LIDAR can now map the wall in 3-dimensions which makes it much easier to study for example how visible forts and fortlets were to their fellow soldiers along the wall.\n\nIn fiction \nThe Antonine Wall is mentioned in Max Brooks' novel World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War (2006) as the last line of defence in Great Britain against the zombies.\n\nThe Northern Wall is also depicted in some of Rosemary Sutcliff's historical fiction novels: as a fully functioning outpost of Roman power in The Mark of the Horse Lord (1965) and as an abandoned ruin in Frontier Wolf (1980).\n\nSee also \n Banknotes of Scotland (featured on design)\n Gask Ridge\n National Museums of Scotland\n Scotland during the Roman Empire\n The Bridgeness Slab\n Trimontium (Newstead)\n World Heritage Sites in Scotland\n\nReferences \n\n \n142 establishments\n140s establishments in the Roman Empire\nBuildings and structures completed in the 2nd century\n2nd-century fortifications\n2nd-century establishments in Roman Britain\nArchaeological sites in East Dunbartonshire\nArchaeological sites in North Lanarkshire\nArchaeological sites in Falkirk (council area)\nRoman frontiers\nWorld Heritage Sites in Scotland\nAntoninus Pius\nScheduled monuments in Scotland\nRoman walls in Scotland\nLinear earthworks"},
{"id": "34764635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein%20Bicycle%20Corporation", "title": "Klein Bicycle Corporation", "text": "Klein was a bicycle company founded by Gary Klein that pioneered the use of large diameter aluminium alloy tubes for greater stiffness and lower weight.\n\nKlein produced his first bicycle frames while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full production runs of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in 2009.\n\nHistory\n\nGary Klein, born , attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.\n\nAfter graduating from MIT in 1974 with a degree in chemical engineering, Klein took a business course for entrepreneurs. As a keen road racer, in 1975, he started a business project with three other people and built a limited run of aluminum alloy framed bikes at the MIT Innovation Center, using a  grant provided by MIT and  of capital from each partner. The prototypes, with larger diameter tubes and thinner walls than those produced in 1973, were displayed at the International cycle show in New York in February 1975.\n\nThe next year, he relocated to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, that had previously been used for dehydrating prunes. In 1977, he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness, and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington. He started production runs of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.\n\nWhile Klein's use of aluminium for a bicycle frames was not entirely novel, his use of large diameter tubes was. Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes he was able to make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.\n\nIn 1995, Trek bought Klein bikes, after Klein found it hard to compete without the sales network of a larger company in place.\n\nAt its peak, around 250 people worked at the Chehalis plant, but operations gradually moved to the main Trek factory in Wisconsin. In 2001, a workforce of around 70 people produced 15,000 to 20,000 frames a year. In 2002, all production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Bikes were still sold under the Klein name until around 2009 in Japan, but widespread distribution ceased circa 2007 in the United States.\n\nA green Klein mountain bike can be seen hanging on the wall in Jerry Seinfeld's apartment in the television show Seinfeld.\n\nInnovations\n\nSome off-road models featured two designs of one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as 'Mission Control' (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material. The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a  threaded steerer. MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, and a special eight pointed wrench was required to remove it. The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust the height of the stem. MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.\n\nKlein held a patent () for an improved method of routing cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.\n\nIn the 2002 model year, Klein replaced 6061 aluminium alloy with a new alloy called ZR 9000, that used zirconium in place of chromium; the new alloy had not been assigned an industry number and it was named after the unused 9000 series. Advertised improvements included a  decrease in weight per frame and a fatigue life five times longer than the 2001 model year frames.\n\nTechniques\nKlein bicycles were famous for their paintwork, and offered a large number of custom colours and patterns. The paint used was a Durethane enamel non-metallic paint that cost up to  per gallon.

{"id": "54141322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20African%20Deep%20Sea%20Trawling%20Industry%20Association", "title": "South African Deep Sea Trawling Industry Association", "text": "The South African Deep-Sea Trawling Industry Association (SADSTIA) represents the trawler owners and operators active in the offshore demersal trawl fishery for hake, the most valuable of South Africa's commercial fisheries, contributing approximately 45 percent of the value of fishery production. Based in Cape Town, South Africa, SADSTIA currently has 32 members that catch, process and market the Cape hakes, Merluccius paradoxus and Merluccius capensis as well as several bycatch species.\n\nThe offshore demersal trawl fishery for hake\nIn South Africa, hake is targeted by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery is by far the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years.  \nTrawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 and 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast.  \nThe offshore demersal trawl fleet consists of 53 trawlers. Twenty six fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 27 freezer vessels produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake or sea-frozen fillets. The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” – gear towed along the seabed with trawl doors (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake. Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled. A five-year benthic trawl experiment was implemented between 2014 and 2019 with the purpose of determining the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It was implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute.   \nThe catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches)  although this has varied between 118 000 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monk (Lophius vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.\n\nA representative industry body\nSADSTIA represents 99.6% of the rights holders in the offshore demersal trawl fishery for hake. The Association interacts with government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other interested parties for the benefit of its members. SADSTIA maintains a professional relationship with a number of scientific and management organisations, which enables it to comment and provide advice on a wide range of issues pertinent to the offshore demersal trawl fishery in particular, or the South African fishing industry as a whole. \nAn executive committee is responsible for the management of SADSTIA and a chairman and/or deputy chairman and executive secretary take care of the day-to-day running of the Association.\n\nSince its founding in 1974, SADSTIA has played a central role in the growth and development of the offshore demersal trawl fishery. For example, the Association was instrumental in harnessing industry and government support for the assessment and accreditation of the South African trawl fishery for hake by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The MSC is an independent non-profit organisation that sets a standard for sustainable fishing. The South African trawl fishery for hake achieved MSC certification in 2004 and was re-certified as sustainable and well-managed in 2010, 2015 and 2021. The expansion by SADSTIA members into markets in northern Europe (Germany and Switzerland for example) has largely been on the strength of the fishery's MSC certification.\n\nTransformation of the industry\nSADSTIA is governed by a constitution that was adopted on 24 March 1974 and updated on 12 September 2002. This was in recognition of the fact that circumstances in South Africa and in the fishing industry changed considerably after 1994, the year of South Africa's transition to democracy. In fact, the structure of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has changed substantially since 1994, in keeping with South African laws and guidelines on black economic empowerment. A study published by the independent empowerment research and rating agency, Empowerdex, in April 2019 found that black shareholding is at least 66.6%. A study by independent economists, Genesis Analytics, updated this figure to 66.8% in 2020.  This is in stark contrast to the period pre-1990 when only a handful of companies held rights in the fishery – all of them large and white-owned. Today, there are 33 rights holders in the fishery. These may be broadly separated into three categories: smaller companies that supply the domestic market with minimally processed hake; medium-sized companies that operate as wholesalers, serving both domestic and international markets; and large companies with sophisticated, vertically integrated operations that process hake for local and international retail markets.\n\nInvestment and opportunities\nThe offshore demersal trawl fishery generates annual sales of hake of R4.3 billion (US$307 million). Approximately 6 600 South Africans are directly employed by SADSTIA members, while another 5 800 indirect jobs are created in associated industries. Jobs are in coastal areas, including Cape Town, Saldanha, Gansbaai, Mossel Bay and Gqebehra.\nInvestments in trawlers and processing facilities by SADSTIA members are believed to amount to R7.6 billion (US$540 million). \nWorkers employed in the South African offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries are well compensated compared to others in the fishing industry. This is because fishing is not seasonal and employment is generally on a permanent basis. And, although most fisheries workers in South Africa do not enjoy the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act of 1997, a unique labour relations framework has been established for seagoing workers in the offshore demersal and inshore trawl fisheries. A Bargaining Council was established in 2001 and a Collective Agreement, that sets out basic conditions of employment – such as set daily wages for each category of worker, set hours of work and regulated rest and leave periods – has been in effect since 2 May 2003.\n\nManagement of the fishery\nThe offshore demersal trawl fishery for hake has been tightly managed and closely monitored since November 1977 when South Africa declared its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) under the United Nations Law of the Sea.\nHaving gained sovereignty over its fisheries resources, South Africa immediately began implementing regulatory and conservation measures, working with the trawling industry to rehabilitate the hake stocks that had been devastated by international fishing fleets. \nToday, the setting of an annual total allowable catch (TAC) remains the primary management measure for regulating the hake fisheries. However, a comprehensive suite of additional measures has been developed and implemented over time to address mainly socio-economic and ecosystem concerns. These measures are as follows: \n Restrictions on vessel power and size were introduced to the inshore trawl fishery in 2003. \n Capacity management measures were introduced to the offshore demersal trawl fishery in 2008. Capacity-limitation models were developed by SADSTIA in partnership with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (now the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment) with the goal of avoiding fleet overcapacity. \n Minimum mesh size regulations aimed at minimising the catch of juvenile fish were first implemented in 1974. \n Paired trawling was prohibited in 1977 in an effort to limit the impacts of fishing on the seabed. \n Restrictions on the lengths and hook spacing of longlines were introduced in 1994.\n Limits on the size and weight of bobbins and foot ropes were introduced in 2003, again in an effort to reduce the impacts of fishing on seabed habitats.  \n Marine protected areas (closed to all forms of fishing) have been introduced for a number of reasons and some impact on deep-sea trawling. For example, a specific time/area closure is aimed at protecting kingklip spawning grounds.  \n Ring-fencing is a voluntary measure adopted by the hake trawl industry in 2008 to prevent the spatial expansion of trawling operations beyond areas that had already been impacted during the development of the fishery, to prevent further impact on the benthic habitat. The ring-fenced area is monitored by vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and compliance is good. \n Mitigation of seabird mortalities includes vessel-specific offal management measures, the mandatory deployment of bird-scaring devices (tori lines) and regulations regarding the greasing of trawl warps. \n Bycatch limitation measures have been introduced and include precautionary upper catch limits, 'move-on' rules and restrictions on the proportions of bycatch species per landing. \nEnforcement of regulations and permit conditions include monitoring of all landings, imposition of fines in the case of minor offences, or full legal action under Section 28 of the South African Marine Living Resources Act that could result in the loss of rights in the event of successful prosecution.\n\nThreats to sustainability\nThe awarding of three prospecting licenses for the mining of marine phosphates from the seabed off the coast of South Africa is of serious concern to SADSTIA and its members. The prospecting license areas and proposed drill sites coincide with much of the footprint of the offshore demersal trawl fishery. As a result of the threat posed by bulk marine sediment mining, SADSTIA has joined the Safeguard our Seabed Coalition which is lobbying the South African government for a moratorium on marine phosphate mining in South Africa.\n\nReferences\n\nOrganisations based in South Africa\nFishing industry"},

Polish forces under Jozef Oxinski clashed with troops (mostly Cossacks) of the Imperial Russian Army, commanded by Mayor Yakov Ogalin.\n\nIn early April 1863, Oxinski's unit stationed for a while at a folwark in the village of Kuzniczka, one kilometer from Praszka. Polish insurgents were closely watched by the Russians, and Oxinski was well aware of it, so he decided to march northeast, closer to the Prussian border, to spend Easter there. An insurgent patrol, sent out on April 11, spotted a group of Cossacks, stationed in the village of Strojec. As turned out later, it was a trap, as a large Russian force was hidden in a forest. Oxinski, who at some point sensed the danger, decided to break through Russian lines in their weakest point, and flee to Wielun.\n\nThe battle took place in a dense forest, and Polish insurgents used bayonets. Using the element of surprise, Oxinski and his men managed to escape encirclement. Poles lost 10 men, while Russian losses amounted to 28 killed. A few days after the skirmish, bodies of 9 unnamed Poles were buried in a mass grave in Praszka. A monument in their memory was later unveiled at the cemetery.\n\nSources \n Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.

The account survives in five manuscripts from the period 1220–1375, including Codex Scardensis, and in five copies of these earlier manuscripts from the period 1600–1800; a summary survives in a manuscript from the 15th century. Of these manuscripts and copies, most are fragmentary or otherwise defective.\n\n'Queen Hel'\nIn Bartholomeus saga postola, Barthalomew is in his assigned apostolic territory of 'India'. The inhabitants there make sacrifices to an idol, and within the idol a devil hides who spiritually entraps men while appearing as if to cure their physical ills. Upon Bartholomew's arrival, he renders the devil impotent, demonstrating his own curative powers by curing the madness of the king's daughter. Bartholomew miraculously appears to the king while he is in his bedchamber, preaches to the king, and offers to expose the devils within the idols the following morning. The next morning, when the pagans start making sacrifices, the devil within the idol says:\n'Stop sacrificing to me, you wretches, lest you have it worse; I am bound with fiery bonds by the angels of Jesus Christ, whom the Jews crucified, thinking him to be a man and susceptible to death; but he made war on Hel our queen and bound the very chieftain of Hell [or Hel, heliar hofđingia] with fiery bonds, and he arose from death on the third day, and gave the sign of his cross to his apostles and sent them into all corners of the earth; and now one of them has come here, and that is who has bound me.'\n\nQueen Hel is not mentioned again in the work. Michael Bell says that while Hel 'might at first appear to be identical with the well-known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld' as described in chapter 34 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, 'in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of Nicodemus she casts quite a different a shadow', and that in  Bartholomeus saga postola 'she is clearly the queen of the Christian, not pagan, underworld'.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Bell, Michael (1983).

He has formerly played with the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Pasquale was selected by the Atlanta Thrashers in the fourth round (117th overall) of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPlaying career\n\nJunior\nPasquale played in the Ontario Hockey League for the Belleville Bulls for parts of both the 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons. Midway through his second season in Belleville, he was traded to the Saginaw Spirit. He would spend the next two and a half seasons here, becoming the Spirit starter in both the 2008/09 and 2009/10 seasons. Praised for traits such as consistency, Pasquale was named to the OHL's third all-star team for the 2008/09 OHL season. He also played in the 2009 CHL Top Prospects game. In his final OHL season, Pasquale stopped over 1800 shots.\n\nProfessional\nThe Atlanta Thrashers selected Pasquale the 117th overall selection of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. Following his junior career, Pasquale was assigned to the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League. Here Pasquale filled the role of backup goaltender, playing in 24 games. He also spent some time in the ECHL, playing with the Gwinnett Gladiators. During the 2011 offseason, the Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and became the Jets. Pasquale started the 2011–12 season by attending Jets training camp, before he was assigned to AHL affiliate, the St. John's IceCaps for the remainder of his entry-level contract.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, Pasquale was traded by the Jets in an exchange of draft picks at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft to the Washington Capitals. Pasquale would never play in a competitive game in the Capitals organization as he sat out the 2014–15 season, recuperating from hip surgery.\n\nOn July 3, 2015, Pasquale as a free agent signed a one-year, two-way contract with the St. John's IceCaps, now affiliated with the Montreal Canadiens. On October 13, he would be sent down to the Canadiens' ECHL affiliate, the Brampton Beast.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, Pasquale signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Detroit Red Wings. During the 2016–17 season, Pasquale appeared in 29 games with the Grand Rapids Griffins, posting a 15–9–5 record, a 2.43 goals against average (GAA), a .919 save percentage and four shutouts, helping lead Grand Rapids to the Calder Cup.\n\nOn July 1, 2017, Pasquale left the Red Wings and signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Edmonton Oilers. On January 31, 2018, the Oilers traded Pasquale to the Tampa Bay Lightning for future considerations. On December 4, 2018, Pasquale made his NHL debut against the Detroit Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena. Pasquale helped the Lightning defeat the Red Wings that night in a 6–5 shootout win. He would play two more games with the Lightning, including the final game of the year where he helped them beat the Boston Bruins, which tied the NHL record for most wins in a season.\n\nIn his second season with the Syracuse Crunch, he won the Harry 'Hap' Holmes Memorial Award. The award goes to the goaltenders of the American Hockey League team with the lowest goals against average, and who have appeared in at least 25 regular season games.\n\nAs an impending free agent, on June 14, 2019, Pasquale opted to sign his first contract abroad since turning professional in 2010, agreeing to a one-year contract with Kazakh based club, Barys Nur-Sultan of the KHL. In his debut season in the KHL, Pasquale had a successful 2019–20 campaign, registering a 2.03 goals against average and picking up goaltender of the week honours on two occasions to help Barys qualify for the post-season.\n\nAs a free agent from Barys, Pasquale was rewarded with an improved two-year contract with Russian based club, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, on May 1, 2020.\n\nInternational play\nIn January 2022, Pasquale was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\nInternational\n\nAwards and honours\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1990 births\nLiving people\nAtlanta Thrashers draft picks\nBakersfield Condors players\nBarys Nur-Sultan players\nBelleville Bulls players\nBrampton Beast players\nCanadian ice hockey goaltenders\nChicago Wolves players\nGrand Rapids Griffins players\nGwinnett Gladiators players\nLokomotiv Yaroslavl players\nIce hockey people from Ontario\nSaginaw Spirit players\nSportspeople from Toronto\nSt. John's IceCaps players\nSyracuse Crunch players\nTampa Bay Lightning players\nIce hockey players at the 2022 Winter Olympics\nOlympic ice hockey players of Canada"},

After his death in 2004, Saathoff was replaced by Jesse Woghin. Woghin was later replaced by Bobby Burg of Love of Everything, Joan of Arc, and Make Believe.\n\nHistory\nImmediately after forming, the band spent eight months recording their self-titled EP. After positive local reviews, the band opened for and toured with a variety of bands, including: Appleseed Cast, the Mercury Program, Pedro the Lion, the American Analog Set, Broken Social Scene, Smog, Minus the Bear, and Pinback. Soon after, the band began to record their debut album, We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers, with John Congleton. Late at night on February 14, 2004, Chris Saathoff was killed in a hit and run accident as he was leaving a Ponys show at a local bar, the Empty Bottle, with his girlfriend. After their benefit shows in honor of their friend, Chin Up Chin Up regrouped to finish recording their album, We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers, while including as many of Chris Saathoff's bass lines as possible. The album was released in 2004 on Flameshovel Records. Chin Up Chin Up released This Harness Can't Ride Anything on October 10, 2006, on Suicide Squeeze, a Seattle-based indie rock record label.\n\nDuring most of 2007 Chin Up Chin Up promoted their new album This Harness Can't Ride Anything by performing many shows. Also for the first time they set foot outside North America to tour through Europe. Late 2007, after their last tour through the west of the USA, they decided that they needed a break. In 2008 Chin Up Chin Up kept very quiet, feeding rumors they had broken up. But in June 2008 they denied this. On their official site it was stated that the five of them 'have just taken some time off to work on other things in their lives'.\n\nHowever, nine months later, in March 2009 lead singer Jeremy Bolen announced on the band's Myspace page that Chin Up Chin Up had indeed broken up and would play their last show on May 15: 'I think I can speak for all of us when I say that we really had intentions to keep making music together for an infinite amount of time, but just as this band began in a natural way it is naturally coming to an end. Thank you to the hundreds of people who have helped us along the way, we have been truly lucky, and as cliché as it may sound, we could not have done any of this without you.'\n\nBolen, Burg, and Sharp went on to play in Vacations, and Dye plays drums in Speck Mountain and The Sweeps.\n\nDiscography\n Chin Up Chin Up – (May 15, 2002; Re-released w/ Bonus Tracks July 26, 2005)\n We Should Have Never Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers – (October 13, 2004)\n This Harness Can't Ride Anything – (October 10, 2006)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n[ Allmusic]\nChin Up Chin Up live on WOXY.com, November 7, 2006\n\nSuicide Squeeze Records artists\nIndie rock musical groups from Illinois\nMusical groups from Chicago\nMusical groups established in 2001\nMusical groups disestablished in 2009\nFlameshovel Records artists"},

{"id": "643201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cederberg", "title": "Cederberg", "text": "The Cederberg mountains are located near Clanwilliam, approximately 300 km north of Cape Town, South Africa at about . The mountain range is named after the endangered Clanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia wallichii), which is a tree endemic to the area. The mountains are noted for dramatic rock formations and San rock art. The Cederberg Wilderness Area is administered by CapeNature.\n\nCederberg is now the generally accepted spelling for the area, which combines the English (Cedarberg) and Afrikaans (Sederberg) variants.\n\nGeography and climate\n\nThe Cederberg mountains extend about 50 km north-south by 20 km east-west. They are bordered on the west by the Sandveld, the north by the Pakhuis Mountains, the east by the Springbok Flats and the south by the Kouebokkeveld Mountains and the Skurweberge. The main access road, the N7, runs to the west of the range. The nearest towns are Citrusdal to the southwest and Clanwilliam to the north. The area is sparsely populated.\n\nThere are several notable mountains in the range, including Sneeuberg (2026 m) and Tafelberg (1969 m). Tafelberg (Afrikaans for 'Table Mountain') should not be confused with the Table Mountain in Cape Town. Notable landmarks include the Maltese Cross, Wolfberg Arch and Wolfberg Cracks.\n\nThe dominating characteristic of the area is sharply defined sandstone rock formations (Table Mountain Group), often reddish in colour. This group of rocks contains bands of shale and in recent years a few important fossils have been discovered in these argillaceous layers. The fossils are of primitive fish and date back 450 million years to the Ordovician Period.\n\nThe summers are very hot and dry, while the winters are wetter and cold with typical annual rainfall in the low-lying areas of less than 700 mm. The higher peaks receive a dusting of snow in winter. Summer days are typically clear and cloudless. Due to the clear skies most of the year, it makes an excellent site for skywatching and has its own amateur observatory.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe predominant vegetation is Mediterranean fynbos in the wetter south and west, changing to semi desert scrub in the north and east. The endangered Clanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia wallichii) of the family Cupressaceae and the snow protea (Protea cryophila) of the Proteaceae are endemic to the area, found only in more remote areas high up in the mountains.\n\nThe area's apex predators are the felids leopard (Panthera pardus) and caracal (Caracal caracal). Other mammals include the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) or 'dassie', meerkats (Suricata suricatta) and other mongooses (Herpestidae), larger antelopes (e.g. bontebok Damaliscus pygargus dorcas and gemsbok Oryx gazella), the vulnerable Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra), and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). There are also many birds, small mammals, reptiles and insects.\n\nOther threatened species found in the Cederberg Wilderness Area include the cyprinids Clanwilliam yellowfish (Labeobarbus capensis, vulnerable), Clanwilliam redfin (Barbus calidus, vulnerable) and sawfin (Barbus serra, endangered).\n\nHuman activity\n\nHistorical\n\nIn caves and overhangs throughout the area, San rock art can be found, evidence of the earliest human inhabitants. European settlement brought forestry and some agriculture, and led to massive destruction of the local cedar trees, with thousands felled for telephone poles, furniture and housing. The European arrival also led to the elimination of the San population. In the north, the old Moravian mission station of Wupperthal still remains, the heart of a small subsistence farming community, and home to a local industry producing veldskoene, traditional soft leather shoes.\n\nThe Cederberg was possibly the southernmost battleground of the Second Boer War. A small band of Boer guerrillas penetrated into this area from the Boer republics, hundreds of kilometres to the north, hoping to stir up popular support amongst the local farmers of Dutch descent. In this they failed; the farmers may have had little sympathy for the British but they had a fair notion of who was going to win the war. It is said that the Boer commandos were confronted in the Cederberg by a lone Englishman, who ordered them to surrender. They laughed at him, because he was one and they were many and tried to reason with him, pointing out the hopelessness of his position. He refused to back down and was in the end shot dead. The place where he fell is today called Engelsmanskloof ('Englishman's ravine').\n\nAgriculture\nArable land is limited by the altitude, the dry climate, and the rocky terrain, and few farms exist. Rooibos tea is the area's most famous export, though fruit and tobacco are also harvested on some farms. The Cederberg area includes one winery, the highest in South Africa. Around the Wupperthal area are a number of subsistence farms. Some commercial pine plantations remain around the Algeria forest station. Proteas and other fynbos plants are also grown. A number of farms have become predominantly guest farms catering for the local and international tourist market.\n\nTourism\nAs a wilderness area, the primary activity is eco-tourism, including camping, rock climbing and hiking. The main campsite, Algeria, is operated by CapeNature, while others such as Sanddrif, Driehoek, Jamaka and Kromrivier are privately operated.\n\nThe Cederberg is renowned for its quality of rock climbing routes particularly around the Krakadouw and Tafelberg peaks. The Table Mountain Sandstone creates ideal conditions for spectacular routes. There are numerous day and overnight hikes including the popular and spectacular Wolfberg Arch, Wolfberg Cracks and the Maltese Cross.\n\nThe area is also home to an amateur astronomical observatory, which regularly hosts open evenings for the public.\n\nThere are various 4x4 routes.\n\nA large tract of the northern Cederberg is owned by the Moravian Church.

He played college football at Towson.\n\nEarly life\nDebaillie was born in Gistel, Belgium on 10 September 1997. His father, Yvan, played American football in the 1980s, as did three of his uncles. Tibo gave up association football and dreamed of playing college football in the United States. When he was 13 he joined the Ostend Pirates of the Belgian Football League, a league of players already in their 20s, because there was nobody in his age category. Over the next few years he earned two player of the year awards and helped his team win the Belgian Bowl XXIX. He also earned four caps with the Belgian national team, including a game against Poland two days after his 16th birthday.\n\nIn 2016, Debaillie was discovered by Europe’s Elite, an organization co-founded by former pro player Brandon Collier that connects talented European prospects with American college coaches. He took a trip to America that summer, visiting Penn State, Maryland, Towson, Albany and UMass as Europe's Elite's first ever representative. Debaillie later took an official visit to Towson with his family in early September, committing to the school in Towson, Maryland shortly afterwards.\n\nCollege career\nDebaillie played college football for the Towson Tigers from 2017 to 2019, logging 29 tackles, 3 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks over 22 career games. He cited the tempo of the game as the biggest adjustment he had to make to play in America.\n\nDebaillie played in all 11 games as a freshman, notably recording a sack against in-state rivals Maryland, but only appeared in two games as a sophomore due to injury. In 2019, he started nine games on the defensive line, recording a career-high nine tackles against The Citadel as well as an assisted sack of Kyle Trask against #9 Florida. The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; head coach Rob Ambrose lamented Debaillie's lost year, saying 'This is his killer year, the one he’s supposed to get to talk about for the rest of his life and one that we get to brag about for the rest of his life.' He was able to secure a flight to Belgium before the country went on lockdown, and had to finish his classes online while staying conditioned.\n\nProfessional career\nAfter recording 31 bench press reps at the CFL Global Combine, Debaillie was drafted by the Edmonton Elks with the 20th overall pick in the 2021 CFL Global Draft. He signed with the team two weeks later, and officially made the roster in August after final cuts. Debaillie appeared in the first two games of the season in a special teams role before being relegated to the practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster again for their week 13 loss to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, where he recorded his first career defensive tackle, before being reverted back to the practice squad.\n\nHe re-signed with the Elks on December 15.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Towson Tigers bio\n\nLiving people\n1997 births\nBelgian players of American football\nBelgian players of Canadian football\nAmerican football defensive linemen\nCanadian football defensive linemen\nTowson Tigers football players\nEdmonton Elks players\nPeople from Gistel"},

In this incarnation of the famous bear, he is a full bodied bear free from the puppeteer's hand.\n\nSetting and location \n\nThe gang live in the Fanshawe Theatre in an unknown English coastal town. The four embark on their adventures through a trapdoor located on the theatre's main stage which would take them to various places and times.  However more often than not the trapdoor fails to send them to their desired location.\n\nMain Characters \nSooty - A quiet and smart bear who is the undisputed leader of the gang. Sooty is the only character in the show that does not talk. And being a mute bear finds communication difficult but often gets what he is trying to say across to the rest of the cast. He wears a pair of bright red dungarees with two white buttons. And usually saves his friends with his trusty magic wand which he is only permitted to use once per adventure.\n\nSweep (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - Now being able to speak with a rather groany sort of voice rather than the 'squeak' he is so well known for.  Sweep is not the brainiest of the bunch and often thinks of nothing else than food which often involves 'sausages'.  A rather cowardly canine, he never usually hangs around when danger is near. He wears green and blue dungarees and a red collar.\n\nSoo (voiced by Susie Blake) - A female panda with an attitude who does not stand for any of the mischief the other two usually get themselves into. Soo could be seen as the sensible one who whips the others into some kind of organisation. She wears a blue dress with a yellow flower on it and a white nappy.\n\nLittle Cousin Scampi  (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - The smallest and youngest of the gang, and Sooty's little cousin too. If mischief has been aroused, it is most probably this little bear who has orchestrated it. Little Cousin Scampi appears in a schoolboy outfit.\n\nOther Characters \nKatarina (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - A well spoken Persian cat who does not believe any of the gang's adventures down the trapdoor. She wears a pink velvet coat and a pink fedora with a feather on the top.\n\nCaptain Fogbound (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - A ginger cat who pilots a hot air balloon and is courting Katarina. He wears an aviator hat, a dark green leather coat and a pair of brown gloves.\n\nCousin McScampi (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - Scampi's Scottish cousin, who is even worse at bagpipe playing than Scampi is, and wants to find the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nThe Aliens (voiced by Rob Rackstraw and Jimmy Hibbert) - Two aliens from the planet Alpha Romeo who become friends with the gang after Sooty saves their spaceship from crashing into the theatre.\n\nMorris the Mouse (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - A male mouse who lives in the skirting boards of the attic that Sooty and the gang live in. He formerly lived behind the skirting boards of the stage, where he had hibernated since the Victorian era, and woke up because he was hungry for some cheese. He is normally very shy, but he sometimes comes along on the gang's adventures. Morris is not to be confused with the field mouse character with the same name from Muffin The Mule.\n\nSir Ray Fanshawe (voiced by Rob Rackstraw) - The former owner of the Fanshawe Theatre, who was buried alive underneath a mountain of sausages. He wears a purple fedora with a feather on the top, a Shakespearean ruff, and a purple Elizabethan shirt.\n\nCaptain Neecap (voiced by Jimmy Hibbert) - A villainous Frenchman who owns both a submarine and a drilling machine. He is often hatching schemes to kidnap Sooty and the gang.\n\nRumoured destruction of master recordings and Archival status \nIn 2014, Richard Cadell claimed in an interview that when he acquired the rights to Sooty from HIT Entertainment in 2008, he received much archived Sooty material in the process. Said materials included the master tapes to the Sooty's Amazing Adventures series, which he destroyed out of personal distaste for the series. Cadell has since been approached by many other outside sources with the idea, and also attempt, of producing an animated CGI version of Sooty, but he does not want such a series to be made.\n\nHowever, it is just a myth, and the entire series still exists in the ITV Archive, even though ITV themselves do not currently own the rights to the series. The BFI National Archive also hold four episodes of the series recorded from their original broadcasts on VHS, and there were two commercial VHS releases of the series in 1997 and 1999.\n\nEpisodes of the series\n\nSeries 1\n\nSeries 2\n\nReferences\n\n1997 British television series debuts\n1998 British television series endings\n1990s British children's television series\nBritish children's animated fantasy television series\nITV children's television shows\nTelevision series by ITV Studios\nTelevision shows produced by Meridian Broadcasting\nEnglish-language television shows\nTelevision series by Cosgrove Hall Films\nSooty\nBritish television spin-offs"},

Previously, she played four seasons at  including in the club's inaugural team.\n\nEarly life and state football\nD'Arcy is originally from Healesville and was introduced to football via her local Auskick program. She switched to soccer before returning to play football with the under-14 boys at Healesville Football Club. After two games she was playing with Yarra Valley Cougars in the senior women's division. Four years after joining the Cougars, D'Arcy joined the Eastern Devils in the VFLW. During her time at the Eastern Devils, she played for both  and  in exhibition matches. Western Bulldogs chose her with pick No. 34 for the 2013 exhibition match. In the 2016 season, D'Arcy kicked 30 goals for the Eastern Devils.\n\nAFL Women's career\nAhead of the 2017 season, Collingwood player Emma King said she thinks D'Arcy will be a star, despite not many having heard of her. She described her as probably one of the best half-forwards with a great hand and great lead, predicting that she'll be very dominant in Collingwood's forward line. D'Arcy made her debut in round 1, 2017, in the inaugural AFLW match at IKON Park against , in which she had 14 disposals and was one of Collingwood's best players. She was one of the standout performers for the club, leading the team with 39 disposals after three weeks.\n\nCollingwood re-signed D'Arcy for the 2018 season during the trade period in May 2017. On 2 September, D'Arcy played for Victoria in the inaugural AFL Women's State of Origin match, where she swapped between full-forward and higher up the ground and kicked a banana goal from an acute angle.\n\nD'Arcy returned to the Collingwood side in round 1, 2018, but was the subject of controversy after she was reported for kicking 's Sarah Hosking in the groin. She was subsequently offered and accepted a two match ban under the AFL's match review system. The incident was assessed under the system as 'intentional conduct medium impact to the groin'. She was the first player in either the AFLW or AFL to be sanctioned under the new system overseen by match review officer Michael Christian.\n\nCollingwood re-signed D'Arcy for the 2019 season during the trade period in June 2018.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2020 season, D'Arcy was traded to Richmond alongside teammate Sarah Dargan, in a package deal in exchange for a third and fourth round pick at the 2020 draft.\n\nStatistics\nStatistics are correct to round 3, 2022\n\n|- style='background-color: #eaeaea'\n! scope='row' style='text-align:center' | 2017\n|style='text-align:center;'|\n| 4 || 7 || 2 || 4 || 48 || 28 || 76 || 18 || 12 || 0.3 || 0.6 || 6.9 || 4.0 || 10.9 || 2.6 || 1.7\n|- \n| scope='row' style='text-align:center' | 2018\n|style='text-align:center;'|\n| 4 || 5 || 0 || 0 || 28 || 15 || 43 || 15 || 12 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 5.6 || 3.0 || 8.6 || 3.0 || 2.4\n|- style='background-color: #eaeaea'\n! scope='row' style='text-align:center' | 2019\n|style='text-align:center;'|\n| 4 || 5 || 4 || 0 || 41 || 13 || 54 || 28 || 6 || 0.8 || 0.0 || 8.2 || 2.6 || 10.8 || 5.6 || 1.2\n|- \n| scope='row' style='text-align:center' | 2020\n|style='text-align:center;'|\n| 4 || 7 || 4 || 11 || 39 || 25 || 64 || 21 || 12 || 0.6 || 1.6 || 5.6 || 3.6 || 9.1 || 3.0 || 1.7\n|- style='background:#EAEAEA'\n| scope='row' style='text-align:center' | 2021\n|style='text-align:center;'|\n| 12 || 9 || 0 || 0 || 49 || 45 || 94 || 18 || 14 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 5.4 || 5.0 || 10.4 || 2.0 || 1.6\n|- \n| scope='row' text-align:center | 2022\n| \n| 12 || 2 || 1 || 0 || 13 || 4 || 17 || 9 || 2 || 0.5 || 0.0 || 6.5 || 2.0 || 8.5 || 4.5 || 1.0\n|-\n|- class='sortbottom'\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 35\n! 11\n! 15\n! 218\n! 130\n! 348\n! 109\n! 58\n! 0.3\n! 0.4\n! 6.2\n! 3.7\n! 9.9\n! 3.1\n! 1.7\n|}\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n\nLiving people\n1991 births\nCollingwood Football Club (AFLW) players\nAustralian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia)\nSportswomen from Victoria (Australia)\nRichmond Football Club (AFLW) players"},

Michael dies, and doctors tell Madeline that her unborn child is dead, too. Madeline, desperate after trying to have a child for years, decides to carry her baby to term anyway. The child, a girl, initially appears stillborn. After a while, though, she seems to revive, and Madeline names her 'Grace'. It soon becomes clear something is wrong with the baby. She develops unhealthy smells, attracts flies, and craves blood.\n\nPlot\nAfter two unsuccessful attempts to have a child, Michael and Madeline Matheson succeed the third time. They consult Madeline's midwife friend, Patricia, to perform an unorthodox delivery.\n\nOne night, Michael and the unborn baby are killed in a car accident . Madeline refuses to begin induction of labor, so Patricia allows Madeline to carry to term. Although initially stillborn, the baby is miraculously alive. Madeline names the baby Grace.\n\nBack at Madeline's home, Grace is attracting flies due to her putrid scent. Madeline also realizes that Grace is unable to digest breast milk as she keeps vomiting. Whilst Madeline is nursing a crying Grace, she realizes that the child is feeding from her bleeding breast.\n\nMeanwhile, Vivian, Michael's domineering mother, wants to visit Grace, but Madeline refuses to answer her calls. She visits Dr. Richard Sohn, an obstetrician she recommended. She convinces him to visit Madeline while looking to collect proof that she is an unfit mother.\n\nMadeline continues to nurse Grace with her blood, which weakens her to the point that she allows Dr. Sohn into her home. He hears Grace cry weakly and starts to her crib. Fearing that he will take Grace away, Madeline kills Dr. Sohn.\n\nVivian arrives just as Madeline finishes draining Dr. Sohn's blood into a baby bottle. After exploring the house, Vivian agrees to leave, but instead finds Grace in her crib, and the bottle of blood broken on the floor. Madeline tries to pursue her, but Vivian is able to grab Grace and flee, discovering Dr. Sohn's body in the process. Vivian arms herself with a hammer; Madeline confronts her, and Vivian beats Madeline unconscious, but not before Madeline rips out part of Vivian's throat with her teeth. They are discovered by Patricia, who sees Grace drinking from Vivian's blood.\n\nSome time later, Patricia is driving a motor home through the desert. She pulls over and goes to the back to check on Madeline, who's nursing Grace. She asserts that as long as Madeline keeps eating the proper diet, they can continue feeding and raising Grace. Madeline informs her that Grace has begun teething, revealing her mutilated breast.\n\nCast\n Jordan Ladd as Madeline Matheson\n Gabrielle Rose as Vivian Matheson\n Samantha Ferris as Dr. Patricia Lang\n Malcolm Stewart as Dr. Richard Sohn\n Stephen Park  as Michael Matheson\n Serge Houde as Henry Matheson\n\nProduction\nShooting began on April 21, 2008, in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nRelease\nGrace premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.  It was released in the US on August 14, 2009.\n\nReception\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 70% of 30 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.63/10 and the site's consensus reads: 'Though not entirely effective as a conventional horror flick, Grace is still a graphic, disturbing, and artful exploration of twisted maternal instinct'.  Metacritic rated it 52/100 based on six reviews. Jon Anderson of Variety called it 'a satirical creepfest that mines modern motherhood for all its latent terrors'. Doris Toumarkine of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, 'Grace whimpers a bit like Rosemary's Baby and gurgles occasionally like The Exorcist, but the video look and bare-bones craftsmanship all scream B movie.' Mike Hale of The New York Times described it as a 'chilly and slow-moving horror film, which plays with ideas of mother love, obsessive child rearing and liberal spinelessness, adding a helping of trendy vampirism.'  Michael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times called it 'a horrifying meditation on the unbreakable union of mother and child'. S. James Snyder of Time Out New York rated it 1/5 stars and wrote, 'Paul Solet's gyno-horror flick is certainly twisted but only slightly unnerving; the movie is about as gripping as one might expect given that its infant monster is both mute and cradle-bound.' Ed Gonzalez of The Village Voice wrote that Grace is creepy but questioned the point of the film.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Grace at FEARnet\n\n2009 films\n2009 horror films\nAmerican films\nAmerican supernatural horror films\nEnglish-language films\nAmerican vampire films\nAmerican pregnancy films\nLGBT-related horror films\nFeatures based on short films\n2009 LGBT-related films"},
{"id": "958174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriente%20Province", "title": "Oriente Province", "text": "Oriente (Spanish for 'East' or 'Orient') was the easternmost province of Cuba until 1976. The term 'Oriente' is still used to refer to the eastern part of the country, which currently is divided into five different provinces. Fidel and Raúl Castro were born in a small town in this province (Birán).\n\nThe origins of Oriente lie in the 1607 division of Cuba into a western and eastern administration. The eastern part was governed from Santiago de Cuba and it was subordinate to the national government in Havana. In 1807, Cuba was divided into three departamentos: Occidental, Central and Oriental. This arrangement lasted until 1851, when the central department was merged back into the West. In 1878, Cuba was divided into six provinces. Oriente remained intact but was officially renamed to Santiago de Cuba Province until the name was reverted to Oriente in 1905. This lasted until 1976, when the province was split into five different provinces: Las Tunas Province, Granma Province, Holguín Province, Santiago de Cuba Province, and Guantánamo Province. This administrative change was proclaimed by Cuban Law Number 1304 of July 3, 1976, and remains in place to this day.\n\nHistory\nDiego Velazquez founded the capital of Oriente province in 1514 and named it Santiago de Cuba. The province comprises 22 municipalities and is Cuba's largest province containing about one third of the country's population. Oriente Province is in the most eastern region of Cuba with a population of 1,797,606. It stretches across  and consists of various mountain ranges with the Sierra Maestra region having Cuba's highest mountain peak and elevation in Pico Turquino. Oriente Province is the cradle of much of Cuba's history being the place of Fidel and Raul Castro's birth. José Martí was killed in battle in Dos Ríos and many guerrilla wars have also taken place in Oriente. Cuba's first guerilla-style war was in 1523. against the advancing Spaniards in the Sierra Maestra Mountains. Some of Cuba's oldest cities are in Oriente Province (such as Baracoa) and carry a rich history of Cuba's struggle for independence and racial equality.\n\nThroughout the 1800s a significant number of enslaved African people were brought to Cuba to work at the sugar mills, although some were brought from Haiti and other neighboring islands because they were also cheap and efficient labor. Open warfare broke out after an independence movement and lasted from 1867 to 1878. Slavery was finally abolished in 1886, but life for many Afro-Cubans remains a struggle, especially in Oriente Province.\n\nAfter the occupation of the Spanish ended in 1899, Oriente Province became a refuge for Afro-Cubans. Oriente had the highest number of individual land owners and renters with 96% of the population being native-born. Afro-Cubans constituted as many as 26% of the land workers. Of the total land owned by Afro-Cubans, 75% were in Oriente Province. Even though Afro-Cubans fared better in Oriente, poverty was still rampant in the province and they remained oppressed by wealthy Cubans and foreign land owners.\n\nSugar and coffee were the main agricultural products produced. And at the highest there were forty-one sugar mills spread throughout the region. Foreign investors saw opportunity within the province and began to buy as much land as possible to increase sugar production. As investors bought land, local farmers were pushed out and frustration increased. Poverty grew and by May 1912 Cubans in Oriente Province had reached a boiling point. Massive demonstrations erupted and Afro-Cubans began to loot and burn businesses and property owned by foreign investors. In response, the Cuban government sent in the army to burn the property of the Afro-Cubans and slaughtered many. Within two years, half of the sugar mills in Oriente were owned by U.S. investors. For Cubans working within the province, life had become near unbearable. The presence of Americans, Jamaicans, Bahamians and Haitians, brought in by the United Fruit Company exacerbated racial problems not present until the U.S. occupation of 1898. Cuba's national hero, José Martí called for a multiracial republic.\n\nList of governors\n\n1500–1799\n\n 1511 Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar\n 1528 Pedro de Barba\n 1532 Gonzalo Ñuño de Guzmán\n 1538 Juan de Rojas;

{"id": "7673484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg%20Kelser", "title": "Greg Kelser", "text": "Gregory Kelser (born September 17, 1957) is a retired American basketball player and current television color commentator. Kelser played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1979 to 1985 and is best known for his standout college basketball career at Michigan State.\n\nEarly life\nKelser grew up in a military family, spending part of his childhood in Okinawa.  He credits his exposure to military discipline with contributing to his later success in athletics.\n\nCollege career\nUpon graduating from Detroit Henry Ford High School in 1975, Kelser was brought to Michigan State by Gus Ganakas, who left the head coach position after Kelser's freshman season. His impressive on-court skills earned him the sobriquet 'Special K', after the locally-made cereal. In his junior year (the freshman year for Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and Jay Vincent) under coach Jud Heathcote, the Spartans squad had an impressive season, racking up a 25–5 record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA tournament, where they made it to the regional finals before losing narrowly to eventual champion Kentucky. As a senior, he along with Johnson led the Spartans to the 1979 NCAA tournament championship, the first in the school's history. He was often on the receiving end of spectacular alley-oop passes from Johnson. He later wrote a book about his basketball experiences at MSU.\n\nKelser finished his career at Michigan State as a 2-time Academic All-American, something he credits Jud Heathcote for keeping him on task to achieve. He was the very first Big-10 player, and remains the only player in Spartan basketball history, to score over 2,000 points with over 1,000 rebounds.\n\nNBA career\nKelser was drafted by the Pistons in 1979, but was later traded to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Vinnie Johnson in 1981. Kelser also spent a season with the San Diego Clippers and part of a season with the Indiana Pacers. Kelser noted that Larry Bird brutally went after him whenever one of Kelser's teams played Boston, surmising that this was because Kelser's Michigan State team beat Bird's Indiana State Sycamores for the 1979 title. Kelser also said that he never sought or wanted to have a friendly relationship with Bird; when asked for a response, Bird said that he didn't recall Kelser ever doing anything of note in the NBA.\n\nPost-NBA career\nSince leaving the NBA, Kelser has worked extensively as a sports announcer and/or commentator on radio and television.\nHe is a commentator for Pistons games on Bally Sports Detroit with his partner George Blaha and on the Big Ten Network.\n\nPersonal life\nKelser, who likes to diversify his activities, has had many interests away from basketball, including collecting soul and jazz records, fishing for silver bass and walleye, playing softball, criminal law with a special interest in juvenile delinquents, and working in a Lansing, Michigan television station in which he and Magic Johnson had a vested interest.\n\nSee also\nList of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Career NBA stats\n\n1957 births\nLiving people\nAfrican-American basketball players\nAll-American college men's basketball players\nAmerican men's basketball players\nBasketball players at the 1979 NCAA Division I Final Four\nBasketball players from Florida\nCollege basketball announcers in the United States\nDetroit Pistons announcers\nDetroit Pistons draft picks\nDetroit Pistons players\nIndiana Pacers players\nMichigan State Spartans men's basketball players\nMinnesota Timberwolves announcers\nPeople from Panama City, Florida\nSan Diego Clippers players\nSeattle SuperSonics players\nSmall forwards\nHenry Ford High School (Detroit, Michigan) alumni\nBasketball players from Detroit\n21st-century African-American people\n20th-century African-American sportspeople"},

{"id": "956135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth%20of%20Valois", "title": "Elisabeth of Valois", "text": "Elisabeth of France or Elisabeth of Valois (; ) (2 April 1545 – 3 October 1568) was Queen of Spain as the third spouse of Philip II of Spain. She was the eldest daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici.\n\nEarly life\n\nElisabeth was born in the Château de Fontainebleau. She was raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d'Humières and Françoise d'Humières. \n\nElisabeth's childhood was spent in the French royal nursery, where her father insisted she share her bedroom with her future sister-in-law, Mary, Queen of Scots, who was about three years older. Although Elisabeth had to give precedence to Mary (since Mary was already a crowned queen), the two would remain close friends for the rest of their lives. \n\nHer lady-in-waiting, Claude de Vineulx, accompanied her to Spain and often wrote reports of Elisabeth's health to Catherine. She was described as being shy, timid and very much in awe of her formidable mother, even as there is evidence in letters that Catherine was tender and loving towards her. While it is acknowledged that her sister Margaret and her future sister-in-law Mary were both prettier than she, Elisabeth was nevertheless still considered one of Catherine's attractive daughters. \n\nIn 1550, Elisabeth's father, Henry, began negotiations for her marriage to Edward VI of England. This arrangement brought condemnation from Pope Julius III who reportedly stated that he would excommunicate both if they married. Henry, undeterred, agreed to a 200,000 ecus dowry, which became irrelevant upon Edward's death in 1553.\n\nQueen of Spain\n\nElisabeth married Philip II of Spain son of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Isabella of Portugal in 1559. Originally married via proxy at Notre Dame (with the Duke of Alba standing in for Philip) prior to leaving France, the actual ceremony took place in Guadalajara, Spain, upon her arrival. The marriage was a result of the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis (1559). His second wife, Mary I of England, had recently died, making Elisabeth of Valois Philip's third wife.\n\nAt her wedding she met the painter Sofonisba Anguissola, and Ana de Mendoza, who would live with her the rest of her life. Philip II appointed Anguissola to be a lady-in-waiting and court painter for his queen. Under Anguissola's tutelage, Elisabeth improved her amateur painting skills. Anguissola also influenced the artistic works of her children, Isabella Clara Eugenia and Caterina Michaela, during her time at the court.\n\nPhilip was completely enchanted by his 14-year-old bride, and by 1564 had given up his infidelities. Despite the significant age difference, Elisabeth was also quite pleased with her husband. (In letters to her mother, she proclaimed herself to be fortunate to have married so charming a prince.) Philip enjoyed hosting chivalric tournaments to entertain his wife.  Elisabeth would play liege lady to the three young princes of the Spanish Court: Carlos, Prince of Asturias, John of Austria (illegitimate son of Charles V), and Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma (son of Charles V's illegitimate daughter Margaret).\n\nElisabeth had originally been betrothed to Philip's son, Carlos, Prince of Asturias, but political complications unexpectedly necessitated instead a marriage to Philip. Her relationship with her troubled stepson Carlos was warm and friendly. Despite reports of his progressively bizarre behavior, Carlos was always kind and gentle to Elisabeth.  When it eventually became necessary for Philip to lock him away (which shortly led to the Prince's demise), Elisabeth cried for days.\n\nPhilip was very attached to Elisabeth, staying close by her side even when she was ill with smallpox. Elisabeth's first pregnancy in 1560 resulted in a stillborn son, followed in 1564 with a miscarriage of twin girls. She later gave birth to Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain on 12 August 1566, and then to Isabella's younger sister Catherine Michelle of Spain on 10 October 1567. Phillip and Elisabeth were very close to both of their daughters buying them jams, dolls, toys and more. It is said 'both rejoiced at the birth of Isabella as if it had been the birth of a son'.  Elisabeth had another miscarriage on 3 October 1568, and died the same day, along with her newborn infant daughter.\n\nAfter the death of Elisabeth, Catherine de' Medici offered her younger daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip. Philip declined the offer.\n\nIn fiction\n\nElisabeth of Valois is a central character in Thomas Otway's play Don Carlos, Prince of Spain; in Schiller's play of the same name;  in Verdi's opera adapted from Schiller's play, also titled Don Carlos; and in several other, less well-known operas. Antonio Buzzolla's version of 1850 is actually named 'Elisabetta di Valois'. All these works imply a tragic romance between Elisabeth and Carlos, suggesting that they were really in love with each other when Elisabeth was forced to break off her engagement to Carlos and marry his father Philip.\n\nIn Madame de Lafayette's novella The Princesse de Cleves, Elisabeth of Valois' marriage to Philip II is the occasion for the wedding games at which her father Henri II dies; her role is brief but it substantially affects the novella's narrative arc.\n\nElisabeth of Valois is portrayed by Caoimhe O'Malley (in the pilot) on the CW show, Reign, then later by Anastasia Phillips in the fourth season of the show. Rather than the “plain Jane” of her family the character is portrayed as beautiful and her timid and shy personality is changed to that of one more forceful, cold, insensitive and quite controlling which is driven out of her legitimate desire for her mother's affections. Her name Elisabeth is spelled with an S instead of a Z though in the fourth season she is simply called Leeza as not to be confused with Queen Elizabeth I. In the first episode, Leeza is married to King Philip of Spain, leaves for Spain with her husband without speaking any lines, and isn't physically seen until fourth season of the show. Though not seen until the fourth season, she is mentioned as a possible option for god-mother to her King Francis' (her brother's) son John in the second season. In the third season, her kingdom is chosen as a safe haven for her younger sisters and brothers after a group calling themselves 'The Red Knights' threaten revenge on the Valois family. Making her physical return to the show, she is one of the four Queens (Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth I and her mother, regent Queen Catherine) to be featured during the season. During her appearance, she spends time in French court as an envoy of Spain and voice of her husband's wishes as well rival for her mother.\n\nElisabeth of Valois is a major character in The Creation of Eve, a novel by Lynn Cullen based on the history of Sofonisba Anguissola, the first renowned female artist of the Italian Renaissance. In the novel, Sofonisba is the painting tutor and premier lady-in-waiting for young Queen Elisabeth.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPeople from Fontainebleau\n1545 births\n1568 deaths\nElisabeth of Valois\nSpanish royal consorts\nRoyal consorts of Naples\nRoyal consorts of Sicily\nElisabeth of Valois\nDeaths in childbirth\nBurials in the Pantheon of Infantes at El Escorial\nWives of Philip II of Spain\n16th-century Spanish women\n16th-century French women\n16th-century Spanish people\n16th-century French people\nSofonisba Anguissola"},

Since the 1950s most poetry in Vietnam is written in free verse. The New Poetry Movement did not just depart from Sino-Vietnamese poetic forms and script, it also introduced more lyrical, emotional and individualistic expression. This poetic movement was contemporary with, and inter-related with, the French realism-inspired realist novels of the Tu Luc Van Doan ('Self-Strengthening Literary Group').\n\nAmong the poets of the 'New Poetry,' Nguyễn Khắc Hiếu, better known by pen-name Tản Đà, (1889–1939) was one of the transitional poets between the old and 'New.' In terms of literary criticism, Hoài Thanh (1909-1982) was the first to make a systematic comparison of the Tho Moi movement with Western poetry.\n\nReferences"},

{"id": "3947300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalcade%20%281933%20film%29", "title": "Cavalcade (1933 film)", "text": "Cavalcade is a 1933 American epic pre-Code drama film directed by Frank Lloyd. The screenplay by Reginald Berkeley and Sonya Levien is based on the 1931 play of the same title by Noël Coward. The film stars Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook.\n\nThe story presents a view of English life during the first third of the 20th century from New Year's Eve 1899 to New Year's Day 1933, from the point of view of well-to-do London residents Jane and Robert Marryot, their children, their close friends, and their servants. Several historical events affect the lives of the characters or serve as background for the film, including the Second Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria, the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and World War I. Throughout the film, the passage of years is indicated by dates on title cards, with a Medieval cavalcade marching in the background.\n\nThe film won three Academy Awards, including  Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nPlot\n\nOn the last day of 1899, Jane and Robert Marryot, an upper-class couple, return to their townhouse in a fashionable area of London before midnight, so they can keep their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast. Although Jane and Robert have been married for some years and have two young sons, Edward and Joey, they are still very much in love. Jane worries because Robert has joined the City of London Imperial Volunteers (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the Second Boer War, where Jane's brother is already fighting in the Siege of Mafeking. Downstairs, the Marryots' butler Alfred Bridges mixes punch for their toast, while Cook dons her finest outfit to attend the public outdoor celebrations. Alfred has joined the CIV as a private and is also leaving soon. His wife Ellen, the Marryots' maid, worries about what will become of her and their new baby Fanny if Alfred is killed or seriously injured, but he is confident despite the pessimistic predictions of Ellen's elderly mother, Mrs. Snapper. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families ring in the new century while Cook dances with other revelers in the street.\n\nShortly thereafter, Jane bids an emotional farewell to Robert at the dock when he boards the troop ship bound for Africa, while Ellen tearfully sees off Alfred, who is leaving on the same ship. While Robert is away, Jane's friend Margaret Harris keeps her company and gives her emotional support. Margaret's young daughter Edith plays Boer War games with Edward and Joey Marryot using toy soldiers and cannons, which distresses Jane. While Jane and Margaret are attending a comic operetta at the theatre to take Jane's mind off the war, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred soon return home unharmed, to the delight of their families, and Robert is knighted for his service.\n\nUpon his arrival, Alfred announces to his wife and mother-in-law that he has bought his own pub with money partly provided by Robert, and he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff have a cup of tea to celebrate Alfred's return, they receive news of the death of Queen Victoria. Robert rides in the beginning part of her funeral procession and the family and staff watch it from their upstairs windows.\n\nA few years later, in 1908, Alfred has developed alcoholism and is managing the pub poorly and getting behind on the family's rent due to spending the rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, who is now in college at Oxford, pay a visit to the Bridgeses' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some Pearlies. An angry Alfred chases Fanny, attacks the Pearlies, and then stumbles into the street where he is fatally run over by a horse-drawn fire engine.\n\nThe following year, on July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny Bridges encounter the Marryot family again at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she and Fanny are living off the proceeds from the pub, now owned by Ellen. Fanny has become a talented dancer and singer. Edward Marryot has fallen in love with his childhood playmate Edith Harris. The family witnesses the historic flight by Louis Blériot over the English Channel.\n\nThree years later, by April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon on a luxurious four-funneled ocean liner, which is dramatically revealed by a camera shot on a life preserver on board to be the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Later scenes make it clear that Edward and Edith both perished in the sinking, although the sinking itself, their deaths, and their families' initial reaction to it are not shown but only briefly mentioned in later dialogue.\n\nTwo years later, in 1914, World War I breaks out. Robert and Joe Marryot both serve as officers, thinking the war will be over within a few months. While on leave, Joe happens upon Fanny Bridges, whom he remembers from their childhood, performing as a featured singer and dancer in a nightclub. He re-introduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a Zeppelin air raid on London from the rooftop. She later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love and Joe, who miraculously manages to survive the next four years of the war despite all his fellow officers being killed in action, spends most of his leave time with her, unbeknownst to his parents. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to say yes due to the difference in their social classes, although she does love him. Just after armistice is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's love affair, goes to see Jane, reveals the affair to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. While a surprised and upset Jane is arguing with Ellen, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly through armistice celebrations in Trafalgar Square.\n\nFollowing the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future.\n\nCast\n\n Diana Wynyard as Jane Marryot\n Clive Brook as Robert Marryot\n Una O'Connor as Ellen Bridges\n Herbert Mundin as Alfred Bridges\n Beryl Mercer as Cook\n Irene Browne as Margaret Harris\n Tempe Pigott as Mrs. Snapper\n Merle Tottenham as Annie\n Frank Lawton as Joe Marryot\n Ursula Jeans as Fanny Bridges\n Margaret Lindsay as Edith Harris\n John Warburton as Edward Marryot\n Billy Bevan as George Grainger\n Ronnie James as Desmond Roberts\n Dick Henderson, Jr. as Master Edward\n Douglas Scott as Master Joey\n Sheila MacGill as Young Edith\n Bonita Granville as Young Fanny\n Claude King as Speaker\n Brandon Hurst as Actor (uncredited)\n Will Stanton as Tommy Jolly (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nFox Movietone newsreel cameramen were sent to London to record the original stage production as a guide for the film adaptation.\n\nFrank Borzage was originally going to direct, but he departed in June 1932 to work on another project. Fox production head Winfield Sheehan decided to use a British director due to the film's setting, and Frank Lloyd was brought on board. Production took place from early October to November 29, 1932.\n\nThe film was one of the first to use the words 'damn' and 'hell', as in 'Hell of a lot'. These had been used in the play. There was concern at the Hays Office that this could set a precedent. Fox president Sidney Kent was quoted saying the mild profanity 'could not offend any person; and, after all, that was the real purpose of the Code. And as far as the use creating a precedent which might be followed by other producers is concerned, the best answer would be that anyone who could make a picture as good as Cavalcade might be justified in following the precedent.'\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on January 5, 1933, but did not go into general theatrical release until April 15.\n\nSoundtrack\nIn addition to several original compositions by Coward, more than fifty popular songs, national anthems, hymns, ballads, and topical tunes relevant to the years portrayed were used in the film. Songs appearing in the film include:\n\n 'Girls of the C.I.V.', 'Mirabelle', 'Lover of My Dreams', and 'Twentieth Century Blues', all by Noël Coward \n 'God Save the Queen'\n 'Auld Lang Syne' by Robert Burns\n 'Goodbye, Dolly Gray' by Will D.

Cohan\n\nReception\nCavalcade was an instant commercial success, earning $1,004,000 in North American rentals, and $3.5 million in worldwide rentals. It made over US $1 million in the UK. It ended up making an estimated profit of £2,500,000 during its initial theatrical release.\n\nMordaunt Hall of The New York Times called the film 'most affecting and impressive' and added, 'In all its scenes there is a meticulous attention to detail, not only in the settings ... but also in the selection of players ... It is unfurled with such marked good taste and restraint that many an eye will be misty after witnessing this production.'\n\nIt was reportedly Adolf Hitler's favorite film.\n\nThe film holds a 65% approval rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10. The site's consensus reads: 'Though solidly acted and pleasant to look at, Cavalcade lacks cohesion, and sacrifices true emotion for mawkishness.'\n\nAwards and honors\nCavalcade won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Frank Lloyd won the Academy Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award for Best Art Direction went to William S. Darling. Diana Wynyard was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress but lost to Katharine Hepburn for Morning Glory.\n\nCavalcade was the first film produced by Fox Film Corporation to win the Best Picture Oscar, and the only one before it merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935 to form 20th Century Fox.\n\nPreservation\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved Cavalcade in 2002.\n\nHome media\nCavalcade was released on a US VHS in 1993.\n\nCavalcade was initially released on DVD December 7, 2010, as the earliest entry in the 75-film, three-volume  'Twentieth Century Fox 75th Anniversary Collection', a prestige set with an initial list price of nearly $500. With the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Wings on January 24, 2012, Cavalcade became the only Best Picture Oscar winner not available on a stand-alone DVD in Region 1.\n\nIt was eventually released separately on a US Blu-ray/DVD set on August 6, 2013, after it received the most write-in votes in a Fox online poll.\n\nThe film is also available for rental or purchase in HD on various US-restricted digital services.\n\n, these are the only official home video releases of Cavalcade anywhere, though several bootlegs are available, most notably a poor quality DVD and BD-R from Spain.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Glancy, H.

This was the start of a new era for the Los Angeles Lakers, as they were coming from an NBA Finals defeat to the Chicago Bulls in five games, but also with the sudden retirement of their long-time superstar, Magic Johnson, after he announced that he was HIV positive. Johnson would briefly come back and play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game along with teammate James Worthy, winning the All-Star MVP award. \n\nDuring the off-season, the Lakers acquired Sedale Threatt from the Seattle SuperSonics. Starting the season without Johnson for the first time since 1979, the Lakers won 10 of their first 13 games, including a nine-game winning streak. However, they struggled in February, losing seven straight games and posting a 3–9 record during the month. The Lakers ultimately finished sixth in the Pacific Division with a 43–39 record, which was their worst record since the 1975–76 season.\n\nWorthy averaged 19.9 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.4 steals per game, but only played 54 games due to a knee injury, while Sam Perkins averaged 16.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, and Threatt provided the team with 15.1 points, 7.2 assists and 2.0 steals. In addition, Byron Scott averaged 14.9 points and 1.3 steals per game, while A.C. Green provided the team with 13.6 points and 9.3 rebounds per game, Vlade Divac contributed 11.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game, but only played just 36 games due to injury, and sixth man Terry Teagle averaged 10.7 points per game off the bench.\n\nAs the #8 seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers were defeated in the Western Conference First Round of the playoffs by the Portland Trail Blazers, 3–1. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy left and took a coaching job with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nDraft picks\n\nRoster\n\nRegular season\n\nSeason standings\n\ny - clinched division title\nx - clinched playoff spot\n\nz - clinched division title\ny - clinched division title\nx - clinched playoff spot\n\nRecord vs. opponents\nThe Lakers were the first team in NBA history to start the season with three straight overtime games, with their season opener being a double-overtime loss to the Houston Rockets. They went 1-2 during that time. After a third loss, to the Phoenix Suns, they went on a nine-game winning streak to finish November with an 11-4 record, which would be their longest winning streak of the season. They struggled in February, going 3-9, with a seven-game losing streak. They would finish the season with a 43-39 record, placing sixth in the Pacific Division and clinching the eighth and final seed for the playoffs.\n\nGame log\n\nPlayoffs\n\n|- align='center' bgcolor='#ffcccc'\n| 1\n| April 23\n| @ Portland\n| L 102–115\n| Scott, Teagle (22)\n| A.

On November 7, 1991, Johnson announced that he had tested positive for HIV and would immediately retire. Johnson discovered his condition after attempting to purchase life insurance and failing the HIV test conducted by Lakers team doctor. During the press conference, he stated that his wife Cookie and unborn child were HIV negative and that he would become an advocate for HIV education and prevention. The NBA world was shocked; U. S. president George H. W. Bush said: 'For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who loves sports.' Johnson was still listed on the roster, as an injured reserve, and continued to be paid.\n\nJohnson was voted in on the West team for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game. Columnists and other people speculated on whether he would play. Because HIV is spread through blood, some players voiced concerns about being infected if Johnson were to get a bleeding wound and touch them. Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone was the most vocal player to express concern. Nevertheless, Johnson played in the All-Star Game, leading the West to a 153-113 win and being named the All-Star Most Valuable Player (MVP). The game ended with 14.5 seconds remaining; when Johnson drained a last-minute three-pointer, other players ran on the court to congratulate Johnson and exchange high-fives. It would be Johnson's last game until he made a brief return at the end of the 1995–96 season.\n\nMagic and the Dream Team\nDespite being HIV positive, Johnson was chosen for the US team for the 1992 Summer Olympics. The squad was quickly dubbed the Dream Team because of its abundance of NBA stars such as Jordan, Karl Malone and Bird, but Johnson was the main attraction. At the Olympic Opening Ceremony, German tennis player Steffi Graf ordered colleague Barbara Rittner to photograph her with Johnson, and in the match against Spain, Spanish captain Juan Antonio San Epifanio and his squad demonstratively hugged him, showing that his HIV infection did not matter to them. During the tournament, Johnson struggled with knee problems and played for only a fraction of the games. The point guard position was mostly run by Utah Jazz all-time assist leader John Stockton, but Johnson's presence alone was enough to provoke standing ovations from the crowd. He used the spotlight to attempt to inspire HIV positive people in several interviews.\n\nAwards and Records\n Magic Johnson, NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award\n Magic Johnson, J.

It is part of a larger rural district known as Yallabatharra.  Lynton is situated at the mouth of the Hutt River, 7.6 kilometres (4.7 miles) by road from Gregory – between the larger towns of Northampton and Kalbarri. During the 1850s, the area was the site of the Lynton Convict Hiring Depot.\n\nHistory\nOn 22 May 1853, the Port Gregory Convict Depot (known later as Lynton Convict Hiring Depot) was built to supply convict labour to the Geraldine lead mine, in the bed of the nearby Murchison River.\n\nThe supervisor of the depot, Captain H. A. Sanford, had a residence constructed in the area during 1853 and named it Lynton. The reason for Sandford's use of the name is unknown, although his parents reputedly had ties to an area by that name in Surrey. The name of Lynton was soon being applied to the broader area around the depot.\n\nAnna Harriette Leonowens, who would became famous as the subject of Anna and the King of Siam (and various adaptations of it), lived in Lynton during the mid-1850s, while her husband, Thomas Leonowens, worked there for the Commissariat. Their son, Louis was born at Lynton in 1856.\n\nThe convict hiring depot was moved to Champion Bay (Geraldton) in 1857.\n\nLynton townsite was not officially gazetted until 1854. The adjoining townsite of Pakington (later renamed Gregory), was gazetted around the same time.\n\nReferences \n\n \nShire of Northampton\nPopulated places established in 1864\n1864 establishments in Australia"},

{"id": "32689208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbooquepa", "title": "Cumbooquepa", "text": "Cumbooquepa is a heritage-listed house at Somerville House, 253 Vulture Street, South Brisbane, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by George Henry Male Addison and built in 1890. It is also known as Brisbane High School for Girls. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.\n\nHistory \n\nCumbooquepa is a large single-storeyed house built in 1890 on a ridge overlooking the South Brisbane Reach of the Brisbane River.\n\nThe land was acquired in 1856 by Thomas Blacket Stephens, a politician, newspaper proprietor and businessman, who became Brisbane's second mayor. Stevens built a timber dwelling called Cumbooquepa on the property. He died in 1877 and management of his estate passed to his eldest son, William Stephens, a politician, businessman and first mayor of South Brisbane.\n\nIn 1890 the Stephens family moved into a new house designed by GHM Addison where they lived until the early 1900s. This second Cumbooquepa was built on a higher part of the site, a short distance from the original which was demolished in 1890 to make way for the south coast and southern suburbs railway line.\n\nThe house remained in the family until 1919 when the property was acquired by the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association as the new premises for the Brisbane High School for Girls. In 1920 Somerville House was added to the title of the school honouring Mary Somerville, a Scottish scientist whose name was also associated with Somerville College at the University of Oxford. Constance Elizabeth Harker and Marjorie Kate Jarrett, important for their contributions to female education in Queensland, were the co-principals of the school from 1909 until the retirement of Miss Harker in 1931.\n\nAn L-shaped two-storeyed educational block was built in 1920 to a design by architects Chambers and Powell with an extension containing a gymnasium and chemistry and biology laboratories completed in 1926.\n\nA two-roomed library building designed by Thomas Brenan Femister Gargett as a memorial to CE Harker was opened in 1935 and extended to include an art studio in 1939–40. The former library includes memorial stained glass windows by William Bustard. It was probably the first purpose-designed library building at a girls' school in Queensland. Recently altered, the building is now used as a chapel.\n\nEarly in 1942 Somerville House became General Headquarters, United Army Forces Far East, United States Army Services of Supply and Base Section 3. TBF Gargett, architect to the US Army, was responsible for adapting the school buildings for the army. During this period the school relocated, reopening at South Brisbane in January 1945.\n\nSince the Second World War various classrooms, a five-storeyed science wing and sporting facilities have been erected. The Constance Harker Hall was built during the 1970s. It houses an 1888 pipe organ by Alfred Hunter & Sons of London.\n\nDescription \nSomerville House comprises structures and landscaping elements, including paths, walls and cuttings on the large triangular block bounded on the north side by Vulture Street and on the west by the railway line. The buildings situated on the main Vulture Street frontage are Cumbooquepa in the north eastern part of the site and, in the northwest corner, the former library/studio building.\n\nCumbooquepa, a single-storeyed masonry and timber house with terracotta tiled and corrugated iron hip roofs, is located on the highest part of the site overlooking the Brisbane River to the north. It is deliberately sited to present a grand hilltop facade addressing the city. Much of the ornament is lavished on this northern facade, the other sides of the building being relatively modest in materials and detail. The house is constructed of red brick on a patterned brick and stone base with timber verandahs to the side and rear elevations. Originally E-shaped in plan, the long northern facade connects central, eastern and western wings arranged around two verandahed courtyards. The central wing contains the entrance hall, reception rooms, dining room and kitchen while the eastern and western wings are used to provide accommodation for boarders and staff.\n\nThe north elevation is a symmetrical composition consisting of bow-fronted pavilions on the eastern and western corners connected by colonnades to a central entry pavilion surmounted by a tower. This front facade is embellished with arches, pediments, quoins, cornices, parapets, balustrades and pilasters with Ionic capitals that are rendered to contrast with the brickwork.\n\nThe central entrance pavilion includes two bow-fronted rooms, a meeting room to the east and study to the west, and a central entrance hall and porch. These rooms have rendered masonry walls, plaster ceilings and feature high-quality timber joinery. The entrance hall, has a marbled tiled floor and is timber panelled to dado height. Stained glass in two fanlights and tall arched niches in its four corners depict Shakespearian characters: Touchstone (As You Like It), Jaques (As You Like It), Portia (The Merchant of Venice), Beatrice (Much Ado About Nothing), Viola (Twelfth Night) and Rosalind (As You Like It). The niche in the southwest corner of the hall opens onto a timber staircase which leads to the tower room. In the study are elaborate built-in timber bookshelves and cabinets and a fireplace with an ornate timber surround.\n\nThe dining room, accessed from a breezeway at the rear of the entrance hall, has rendered walls with timber wainscoting and an ornate coved and panelled ceiling that is lined with diagonal tongue and groove boards. The room, which overlooks both courtyards, is embellished with stained glass windows in arched openings, elaborate timber lintels over the entry doors, built-in timber furniture, two fireplaces and bay windows in arched recesses.\n\nCirculation throughout the building is via the extensive verandahs and colonnades, all of which are now enclosed. The southern ends of the courtyards, once open, are now blocked off by two brick bathroom wings with storage areas underneath. The house has six brick chimney stacks, some of which are highly ornate.\n\nWhile the former house is elevated high above the street, the former library/studio building, now the chapel, steps down the site. Built on a finger of land between the entry driveway, Vulture Street and the railway line, the building which is integrated with the adjacent pathway, steps and walls, forms an entry onto the site. The former library is a one-storeyed buttressed brick structure with contrasting rendered details including castellated parapets, window frames, arches and base and has steeply pitched terracotta tiled roofs. It was designed in the English Perpendicular 'gothic revival' style.\n\nThe octagonal north end has four stained glass memorial windows which are the work of Brisbane artist William Bustard. The interiors have been altered and a new entry constructed at the southern end.\n\nThese buildings of Somerville House are all red brick with cement render details and form a cohesive and intact group prominently located above the historic precinct surrounding South Brisbane Memorial Park and adjoining the former South Brisbane Town Hall.\n\nHeritage listing \nCumbooquepa was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\n\nCumbooquepa is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history as evidence of education for girls in Queensland.\n\nThe place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.\n\nCumbooquepa is an uncommon example of a large late 19th century residence, which is exceptional for its architectural quality, lavish interiors, and prominence as a landmark.\n\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\n\nThe school buildings are important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic qualities valued by the community, in particular the architectural distinction of the former library/studio building, the high quality of the stained glass and timber joinery in Cumbooquepa and the former library/studio building, the cohesive and picturesque grouping of landscape elements and buildings, the contribution of the wall and garden to the streetscape and the contribution to the townscape as a landmark.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nCumbooquepa has a special association with the Brisbane High School for Girls.\n\nThe place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.\n\nCumbooquepa has a special association with the Stephens Family, CE Harker, MK Jarrett and the US Army and Brisbane architects, GHM Addison, and TBF Gargett and artisan William Bustard, and are important examples of their work.\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\nQueensland Heritage Register\nSouth Brisbane, Queensland\nPrivate schools in Queensland\nHouses in Brisbane\nArticles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register"},

His work and his teaching would have a profound influence on her own work.\nIn 1962 Ellen Marx went to Paris and two years later established an atelier 40 km from Paris where she still lives and works.\nAfter the research work of E.Chevreul, Johannes Itten and Josef Albers, Marx has quantified objectively, for the first time, color relativity in her book Optical Color and Simultaneity. In parallel to the publication of the book in 1983, a solo exhibition took place at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. The color reliefs in this exhibition were interactive and changed constantly with the view point of the spectator. Numerous other group and solo exhibitions were held in Europe, notably Relief Concrete in Germany today with the German artists of Concrete Art in the Modern Gallery of the Museum of the Saar, Germany in 1981. In 1989 Marx's French editor Pierre Zech published in the collection 'Le Temps Apprivoisé' her book 'Méditer la couleur' which examines in great detail the phenomenon of successive contrast.\n\nMarx was invited to be the Keynote Address Speaker of the International Conference on Color Education  which was organized by the University of Art and Design in Helsinki and which showed in parallel her work in an exhibition alongside paintings by Josef Albers.

{"id": "32346808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level%20of%20Repair%20Analysis", "title": "Level of Repair Analysis", "text": "Level of Repair Analysis (LORA)  is used as an analytical methodology used to determine where an item will be replaced, repaired, or discarded based on cost considerations and operational readiness requirements. For a complex engineering system containing thousands of assemblies, sub-assemblies, components, organized into several levels of indenture and with a number of possible repair decisions, LORA seeks to determine an optimal provision of repair and maintenance facilities to minimize overall system life-cycle costs. \n\nLogistics personnel examine not only the cost of the part to be replaced or repaired but all of the elements required to make sure the job is done correctly. This includes the skill level of personnel, support equipment required to perform the task, test equipment required to test the repaired product, and the facilities required to house the entire operation.\n\nProcess\nLORA establishes when and where each unit will be repaired and determines if it is more cost effective to discard an item than attempt to repair it. While this kind of analysis seems costly and unnecessary, at enterprise scales over many years, significant cost savings can be realized.\n\nFor example, the LORA process may discover that replacing a part actually costs hundreds of times that amount, when all cost are considered (maintenance manpower, warehousing facilities, shipping, etc.).  If this part is replaced hundreds of times per year, over the course of many years, then there may be an opportunity to save money by adjusting the repair process to leverage this economy of scale (reliability improvements, component repair, etc.).\n\nThis analysis drives the maintenance support for each repairable unit analyzed.  LORA is the most important physical supportability analysis business decision made during acquisition of a system.\n\nLORA is performed in two steps:\n\n Establish noneconomic decision criteria used to make initial support decisions\n Evaluate alternative economic models to determine the most cost effective support solution for the system. \n\nThe LORA process produces the final support solution for the system. It determines where each required maintenance action will be performed, the physical resources that must be available to support performance of maintenance, and what the support infrastructure must be capable of sustaining throughout the operational life of the system. The results of LORA are documented and used as the basis for development of the physical resources for support of the system.\n\nRepair levels\n\nThe LORA process starts by identification of the options where maintenance can be performed. It is common for systems to use 2 or 3 levels of maintenance. LORA produces a decision for each item within the system, indicating where each maintenance action for the item will be performed.\n\nOrganizational level maintenance\n\nOrganizational, or O-level maintenance occurs at the organizational unit level, for example by a single maintenance squadron as part of an aircraft wing.\n\nO-level maintenance is typically optimized for quick turn-around, to enhance operational availability.  Maintenance at this level typically consists of immediate remove and replace (R&R) operations that replace failed (unserviceable) LRUs with spare (serviceable) assets taken from inventory.  Repair-in-place (RIP) procedures are also common.\n\nIntermediate level maintenance\n\nIntermediate, or I-level maintenance occurs in specialized backshops that are typically allocated to multiple operating units residing at a common operating location, for example, an entire wing or multiple wings at an operating base.\n\nBecause it is more specialized, I-level maintenance allows for more thorough and time-consuming diagnostic testing and repair procedures, usually in support of failed items removed at the organizational level of repair.  Test equipment is more common at this level of repair, and is used to automate many test procedures.  Spare parts maintained at this level of repair are known as bench stock.\n\nIntermediate-level maintenance deployment can vary widely, and is highly dependent on desired operating conditions.  In minimal maintenance concepts, there may be minimal or no I-level maintenance, a system known as two-level maintenance (O-level & D-level).  A system deploying a typical I-level repair capability would be known as a three-level maintenance system (O-, I-, and D-level).\n\nDepot-level maintenance\n\nDepot, or D-level maintenance typically occurs in highly specialized repair depots, or at original equipment manufacturer (OEM) facilities.  These sites are typically not at operating locations, and extensive diagnostic equipment and possibly even manufacturing capabilities exist.\n\nEquipment overhauls and modifications are typically executed at this repair level.\n\nDecision considerations\n\nNon-economic LORA decision criteria are a list of rules or guidelines that are used to determine if there is an overriding reason why maintenance should be performed. Some organizations have policies that any item costing less than a predetermined price level will be discarded and replaced rather than be repaired.\n\nOther decisions are addressed using cost models that calculate the possible costs of all support options and then identify the least cost solution. Then the total cost of each option can be compared to determine the lowest option in terms of long-term support over the life of the system.\n\nSee also\n\n Logistics support analysis\n DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HANDBOOK: LEVEL OF REPAIR ANALYSIS, MIL-HDBK-1390\n AS1390, Level of Repair Analysis (LORA)\n\nReferences\n\nUnited States Department of Defense"},

The Boars won their first three games in the All-Filipino Cup and were on top of the standings with six wins and one loss after the first round of eliminations, losing only to Alaska on March 2.  The Boars finish with the best record of 10 wins and four losses, despite losing their last two assignments. \n\nGordon's Gin and traditional All-Filipino powerhouse Purefoods Corned Beef Cowboys easily made it to the finals and the two most popular teams will play against each other in the championship for only the second time in their history since they last played way back in the 1988 All-Filipino finals, won by Gordon's Gin (then Añejo Rum 65). \n\nIn the All-Filipino Cup finals series, the Boars lost to the more experience Cowboys in six games with Alvin Patrimonio playing superb for Purefoods in the title-clinching Game Six, scoring 40 points to lead his team to an 82-73 win.\n\nChampionship\nImport Tyrone Hopkins led the Boars to the Commissioner's Cup semifinals with six wins and four losses and tied with three other teams at first place. Starting the semifinal round, the hardworking Hopkins was unexpectedly replaced by NBA veteran Chris King.  Gordon's Gin and San Miguel Beermen battled it out for the second finals berth after the Alaska Milkmen advances first. On August 24, the Boars outlasted San Miguel in two overtimes, 106-100, for their third straight finals appearance. \n\nIn the best-of-seven title series against defending champion Alaska, the Boars went up 3-0 and on a verge of a four-game sweep but the Milkmen came back with victories in Games four and five. On September 7, Gordon's Gin ended a six-year title drought when they wrapped it up in Game six as they held Alaska to only five points in the third quarter to pull away with a 30-point lead, 79-49, going into the final 12 minutes. The Boars won in a convincing fashion, 105-79, for their first championship since they last won a crown in 1991. Boars' playing-coach Sonny Jaworski became the oldest active player to win a PBA title.\n\nNotable dates\nFebruary 23: Bal David dribbled past the midcourt line with three seconds to go and threw a prayer of a shot that went in as the buzzer sounded to lift Gordon's Gin to an 83-81 win over San Miguel Beermen for their second victory. \n\nMarch 8: Gordon's Gin gifted playing-coach Sonny Jaworski on his 51st birthday with an 86-79 win over Purefoods in Iloilo City. The Boars raised their record to a league-leading 5-win, 1-loss slate. This is the first time in nine seasons that the two rivals and most popular ballclubs play in an out-of-town game.  \n\nAugust 24: In the knockout game for the right to play Alaska in the Commissioners Cup finals, Gordon's Gin were trailing by five points against the San Miguel Beermen in regulation, 75-80 with 51 seconds left, Boars import Chris King hit a three-pointer to cut the lead to two points and he issued a nice feed on Noli Locsin with nine seconds to go as Gordon's forces overtime at 80-all. The playoff match went into second overtime after Beermen Olsen Racela missed his second free throw and Marlou Aquino threw a long pass on Bal David for the go-ahead basket with 1.5 seconds remaining, forcing second extension at 94-all. San Miguel lost import Jeff Ward to injuries in the final five minutes as Gordon's Gin pulled away with a 106-100 victory.\n\nOctober 10: New Boars import Leon Trimmingham debut with 34 points as Gordon's Gin nip Sta.Lucia Realtors, 97-96.\n\nOccurrences\nAn incident occurred during the April 29 semifinals game between Gordon's Gin and San Miguel Beermen which was won by the Boars, 98-94. Beerman Allan Caidic fell hard on the floor after an accidental collision between him and teammate Nelson Asaytono who leap in the air for a rebound, Boars' playing coach Sonny Jaworski was accused for his behavior when in full view of the thousands watching live at the Cuneta Astrodome and on live TV, the vintage camera captured Jaworski appearing to be arguing with game officials for Allan Caidic to be removed from the playing floor and went to the extent of making a 'slit-the-throat' gesture, public response was immediate and callers swamped TV and radio stations to express their disgust, the controversy regarding the Big J's acts on the much-publicized accident has stirred a debate and mixed reactions from everybody putting in their worth of opinion.\n\nCenter Edward Joseph Feihl, who decided to sit out upon wanting to get a better contract during the off-season negotiations and has since refused to sign up with Gordon's Gin and opted to play in the PBL for AMA Computer College instead was traded to Purefoods on July 21 in exchange for Cris Bolado, who started playing for the Boars in the Governor's Cup. \n\nPurnell Perry, a former Tanduay import in the PBL, played one game and the Boars lost to Mobiline, 117-136, in their first outing in the Governor's Cup on September 23. Perry was replaced by Dennis Edwards, another former Tanduay import in the PBL. Edwards led Gordon's Gin to three straight victories but when the much-talk about Leon Trimmingham, the Most Valuable Player in the Australian League and known as 'Flight 44' became available, Edwards was sent home.  Trimmingham's inconsistent performance in which the Boars won four of the nine games he played had convince the coaching staff to replaced him with Andy Bostick, a veteran of Venezuelan and Swedish league, with only one game left in their elimination round assignments.\n\nRoster\n\nReferences\n\nBarangay Ginebra San Miguel seasons\nG"},

The woody vine or stem of the plant has a hot, peppery and chili flavour, with a lingering aftertaste and slightly numbing sensation to the tongue. It is commonly used in Lao cuisine both in Laos and the predominately Lao ethnic region of Northeastern Thailand. It is the most important ingredient in Laos' famous Or lam. \n Its berries are sometimes pressed for an oil that is also used in cooking.\n\nPiper ribesioides,  is a lesser known woody species known to occur in Laos, Myanmar, Andaman-Nicobar Islands, and Malesia. This taxon was located in the Andaman Islands in 1834 by Dr Helfer, a geologist who made extensive botanical collections from Tenasserim (Myanmar) and the Andaman Islands. Unfortunately, he was murdered by the indigenous people of the northern Andaman Islands and his collections from Tenasserim and Andaman Islands were mixed up, causing much confusion about the geographical origin of the botanical collections.  Hence the locality of all herbarium collections made by Helfer have been designated as Tenasserim/Andaman Islands. Exact occurrence of several collections made by Helfer was later reconfirmed by other botanists during their explorations. One of his collections deposited at Central National Herbarium, Howrah (CAL) designated the locality as Tenasserim/Andaman Islands was Piper ribesioides;  however, the occurrence of this species in Andaman Islands was doubted until its rediscovery in 1990 by Mathew and Abraham. This woody climbing liana is evidently rare in the Andaman Islands. Living accessions of this rare insular species from the Andaman Islands is conserved at the Field Gene Bank of Jawharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, Trivandrum, South India.\n\nReferences\n\nribesioides\nFlora of Myanmar\nLao cuisine"},

It is near the Victorian–South Australian border,  north-west of Melbourne.  Named after James Service, who was Premier of Victoria in 1880 and from 1883 to 1886, it was established when the inter-colonial railway line between Adelaide and Melbourne was completed in 1887. The railway station served as the change-over point for train crews and locomotives of the Victorian Railways and South Australian Railways since neither could operate in the other colony.\n\nThe  recorded a population in Serviceton and the surrounding area of 120; there were 77 dwellings.\n\nThe town is the subject of a Tom Waits song entitled 'Town With No Cheer' from his album Swordfishtrombones.\n\nServiceton Post Office opened in 1886; from 1908 to 1911 it was known as Serviceton Railway Station post office. A Serviceton South office was open in 1926–1927, and Serviceton North office, on the Western Highway, operated from 1911 until 1954.\n\nGolfers play at the course of the Serviceton Golf Club on the Western Highway.\n\nBorder dispute\n\nThe eastern border of South Australia was declared in 1834 to be the meridian of the 141st degree of east longitude. In 1847, however, owing to the limitations of technology used for the first survey, markers were placed in error. Subsequently, the border was understood by both colonies to be about  west of the meridian. Nevertheless, a border was not formalised and it was reported that 'a number of bad characters resort to this neutral ground, knowing that the police cannot interfere  with them until the question of jurisdiction is determined.' Seventy-five years of legal dispute were only resolved in 1914, with the judgement of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  that the erroneously surveyed line was to be the legal border. Serviceton was thus placed within Victoria. Modern technology shows the border to be  west of the 141st meridian and Serviceton  west of the meridian.\n\nRailway station \n\nThe railway station was completed in 1889 as the point at which the Serviceton railway line of Victoria and the Adelaide-Wolseley railway line of South Australia – together comprising the Inter-colonial Railway line – joined. The station building, for which the cost was shared between the two colonies, had 15 main rooms, including a large refreshment room and two customs offices and two booking offices for the separate systems. When Australia federated in 1901, inter-state customs collection ceased, but locomotives continued to be changed until the 1980s. As of the 2010s, the building was leased by V/Line to the Shire of West Wimmera and managed by a committee elected from the local community to voluntarily operate, maintain and preserve it.\n\nAs of 2004, passenger trains, including The Overland interstate service, did not stop at the station.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links \n \nServiceton Vic\n\nTowns in Victoria (Australia)\nWimmera"},

She was born in January 1933 in Flanders, but has spent most of her life in French-speaking Brussels and Liège, Belgium. She is noted for her theory of Cue Abstraction, and for her work in establishing the European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music.\n\nBiography\n\nIrene Deliege is a cognitive scientist, specialising in Music Cognition. She was born in January 1933 in Flanders, Belgium.\n \nShe was educated at [details]  and the Royal Conservatory of Brussels from where she obtained a diploma in music.  For 25 years, she worked as a classroom music teacher in the Belgian public (state-funded) school system.\n \nShortly after graduating she began to attend the courses music writing and harmony given by Profressor Andre Souris at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, and as a result was invited to attend the Summer School for New Music in Darmstadt (Darmstädter Ferienkurse), where she met the Belgian musicologist Celestin Deliege, whom she married in 1954.\n \nIn 1979 she decided to return to study, and gained a bachelor's degree in Psychology from the Free University of Brussels (Université libre de Bruxelles), graduating in 1984.   She was then invited by Professor Marc Richelle, Head of the Psychology Department at the University of Liège to establish a Unit for Research in Psychology of Music, in association with the Royal Conservatory of Brusselsand the Centre de Recherche et de la Formation musicales de Wallonie (CRFMW) founded by the composer Henri Pousseur.  The Unit existed from 1986 until her retirement in 199?\n \nSimultaneously with establishing the Unit, she embarked on PhD studies at Liege, gaining her PhD in 1991.  Its title was L'organisation psychologique de l'écoute de la musique. Des marques de sedimentation indice, empreinte dans la representation mentale de l'oeuvre.' ' (The psychological organisation of musical listening).\n\nThe European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music\nIn 1991, she was elected first Permanent Secretary of the newly founded European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of  Music (ESCOM).  This organisation, whose foundation she led, was in part a response to the earlier formation of the North American Society for Music Perception and Cognition (SMPC).   In 1989 SMPC collaborated with the Japanese Society of Music Perception and Cognition to host the first International Conference of Music Perception and Cognition (ICMPC), held in Kyoto, Japan.   At the second ICMPC, held in Los Angeles in 1992, Irene Deliege proposed that the third conference should be in Europe, and that a biennial rotation between North America, Europe, and the Far East and Australasia should thereafter be maintained.  Her proposals were accepted as the long-term structure for ICMPC, which recently held its 12th conference attended by over 500 delegates.  ESCOM has been the European host for four ICMCPs to date (Liege, Belgium 1994; Keele, UK 2000; Bologna, Italy 2006; Thessaloniki, Greece 2012).\n\nAlongside the ICMPC, Irene Deliege also took a leading role in the stimulation and organisation of European scientific meetings, and the editing of multi-author volumes dedicated to specialist topics within the field of music cognition.   2012 saw the first publication  in a new series of Classic European Music Science Monographs, a project to commission and publish English translations of seminal historic European treatises on systematic and scientific musicology from 20th and earlier centuries. Translations are funded from a special “Irène Deliège Translation Fund” endowed to ESCOM in 2010.\n\nIn 1997, ESCOM founded a new scholarly journal, Musicae Scientiae.  Its first Editor was Irene Deliege, who held this position, as well as General Secretary of ESCOM, until 2009.    The journal has a unique remit, covering empirical science, artificial intelligence, education, systematic musicology, and philosophy.   The publisher Sage took on the journal in 2009, and its impact factor in 2012 was 0.729.\n\nScientific contribution\nDeliege's scientific work involved some of the first, and certainly some of the most influential, attempts to empirically test major predictions of the work of Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff as laid out in their groundbreaking Generative Theory of Tonal Music (1983).   This work involved novel methods for measuring perception of medium- to large-scale structure, up to and including entire works; going substantially beyond most scientific work of the time which concentrated (and still, to a large extent does) on perception of small, disembodied musical fragments.   Another important aspect of her work was a courageous exploration of these issues as applied to contemporary classical music, including atonal works, another challenge largely neglected in the wider field. She also made important contributions to the understanding of the development of musical perception through infancy and childhood.\n\nBibliography\n1985.

Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, he threw and batted right-handed and was listed as  tall and .\n\nThies graduated from DeLaSalle High School and Saint Mary's University of Minnesota (Class of 1959), where he played baseball and basketball. He signed with the Athletics in 1959 and spent his entire six-season pro career in the Kansas City organization. In 1961, Thies' best minor league campaign, he won 15 games and lost seven for the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League, with 11 complete games and two shutouts. \n\nIn 1963, he spent the first weeks of the major-league season on the Kansas City roster, making seven relief appearances and two starts. In his first start, May 4 at Municipal Stadium against the Boston Red Sox, Thies was staked to an 11–3 lead — thanks, in part, to his two-for-two performance at the plate. Thies drove in a run with a single in his first at bat, then doubled in his second plate appearance, scoring a run himself, the Athletics' eighth of the game. But, on the mound, Thies could not complete the fourth inning. He was relieved by Bill Fischer after allowing four hits and one earned run in 3 innings pitched. Fischer shut down the Red Sox for another 1 innings and received credit for the win in Kansas City's rain-shortened, 14–3 triumph. Thies' second starting assignment occurred June 1, at District of Columbia Stadium against the Washington Senators. After shutting out the Senators in his first two innings, Thies gave up four earned runs in the third, including a three-run home run to Don Lock. He was removed for a pinch hitter in the fifth inning, and absorbed the 9–1 Kansas City loss, the only decision of his big league career.\n\nAfter his last MLB appearance on June 7, Thies returned to the minor leagues and pitched into 1964 for the Athletics' Triple-A affiliates. In his nine big-league games, Thies allowed 26 hits and 12 bases on balls in 25 innings pitched, with nine strikeouts, two hit batsmen and one wild pitch. At the plate, he batted .333 on the strength of his May 4, 1963, game against the Red Sox, with six total at bats and two hits.\n\nHe was elected to the Saint Mary's University of Minnesota's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBaseball-Reference.com Career Stats\n\n1937 births\nLiving people\nAlbany Senators players\nBaseball players from Minneapolis\nDallas Rangers players\nHawaii Islanders players\nKansas City Athletics players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nPortland Beavers players\nSaint Mary's Cardinals baseball players\nSaint Mary's Cardinals men's basketball players\nSioux City Soos players"},

The Vikings' first draft selection as an NFL team was Tommy Mason, a running back from Tulane University. The team's most recent first-round selection is Christian Darrisaw, an offensive tackle from Virginia Tech.\n\nEvery April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate draft known as the 'NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting', more commonly known as the NFL Draft. Teams are ranked in reverse order based on the previous season's record, with team with the worst record picking first, the team with the second-worst record picking second, and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion always picks last and the Super Bowl loser always picks second-last. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.\n\nThe Vikings have selected number one overall twice. The Vikings received the first pick in 1961 as an expansion franchise and then again in 1968 when the franchise chose Ron Yary, an offensive tackle from the University of Southern California. The Vikings have used first-round selections on players from the University of Southern California five times, Michigan State University four times, and from the University of Notre Dame, Oklahoma State University, Ohio State University, Florida State University and North Carolina State University three times. The Vikings have drafted 10 running backs, the most common position drafted by the franchise, followed by defensive end (9), defensive tackle (8), defensive back (8) and wide receiver (8). Six eventual Hall of Famers have been selected by the Vikings in the first-round: Carl Eller, Alan Page, Chris Doleman, Randall McDaniel, Ron Yary and Randy Moss.\n\nKey\n\nPlayer selections\n\nBy college\n\nBy position\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nMinnesota Vikings\n \nMinnesota Vikings lists"},

It included preserving forests, encouraging the use of alternate fuels, and increased study of climate change. The plan was first prepared in 2008 and had then been updated every two years.\n\nPresident Obama's last Climate Action Plan, issued in June 2013, included regulations to industry with the ultimate goal of cutting domestic carbon emission, preparing the U.S. for impending effects of climate change, and working internationally to address climate change. Among the regulations outlined in the plan were initiatives to increase natural disaster preparedness, create and improve existing hospitals, and modernize infrastructure to better withstand extreme weather.\n\nThe plan would have support conservation of land and water resources and developing actionable climate science, and encouraged other countries to take action to address climate change, including reducing deforestation and lowering subsidies that increase use of fossil fuels. The plan specifically mentioned methane, building efficiency, wind, solar and hydroelectricity.\n\nWhite House staff members who were directly tasked with implementation of the plan included Heather Zichal and Michelle Patron.\n\nCancellation and reinstatement of the Climate Action Plan \nOn the first day of the presidency of Donald Trump, the White House website announced that Obama's Climate Action Plan would be eliminated, stating it is 'harmful and unnecessary'. In March 2017, Trump signed an executive order to officially nullify Obama's Clean Power Plan in an effort, it said, of reviving the coal industry. In January 2021, on the Inauguration Day of U.S. president Joe Biden, Trump's executive order was revoked by the executive order 'Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis', thereby re-instating the Obama Climate Action Plan.\n\nSee also \n Climate Action Plan\n Climate change in the United States\n National Climate Assessment\n National Research Council, report on climate change\n State of the Climate\n\nReferences \n\n Executive Office of the President.

Named by N.B. Davis in 1918, the formation is characterized by white kaolinitic clay and is a source of high-quality refractory clay. The type locality has been designated as Dempster's clay pit northwest of Eastend, Saskatchewan.\n\nAlthough fossils are generally lacking in the Whitemud Formation, in southern Saskatchewan the Whitemud contains coprolites (fossilized feces) and fossilized intestines of fish.\n\nLithology\nIn most areas the formation can be subdivided into three units:\n\n Lower: Medium-grained arkosic and kaolinitic sandstones with trough cross-bedding.\n Middle: Brown fissile carbonaceous shales and siltstones, with thin lignite beds.\n Upper: Clays and siltstones, with some thinner, tabular units of simple and planar cross-bedded kaolinitic sandstones.\n\nIn southwestern Alberta around the Red Deer and Oldman Rivers, the middle carbonaceous shale unit is absent and the formation consists of white-weathering, cross-bedded kaolinitic sandstones interbedded with white- to cream-weathering silty and sandy clay.\n\nEnvironment of Deposition\nSedimentology and fossils indicate that the Whitemud sediments accumulated in river channels, low-gradient streams, and shallow lakes and ponds on a low-lying coastal plain. Its kaolinite was produced by intense chemical weathering that altered the original feldspar content to kaolinite during and after deposition.\n\nEconomic resources\nKaolinite-rich clays have been quarried from the Whitemud Formation since before 1920 and are used in the manufacture of stoneware products ranging from pottery to sewer pipes.\n\nPaleontology\n\nPlant fossils and palynomorphs found in the carbonaceous shales indicate the presence of aquatic plants such as water lilies, as well as trees and shrubs related to figs, hickories and redwoods.\n\nCoprolites provide the only evidence of vertebrates. In southern Saskatchewan the formation contains scattered coprolites that represent feces of fish, most probably sturgeons. The feces have been preserved due to the replacement of the original fecal material by goethite, siderite and other iron minerals. They typically range in length from about 2 to 10cm (1 to 4 in), although specimens as long as 23cm (9 in) have been reported. A variety of coiled and uncoiled morphologies have been described, and some spiral forms with intricate systems of internal folds are thought to represent fossilized intestines containing feces that were unexpelled when the fishes died.\n\nRelationship to Other Units\nThe Whitemud Formation is part of the Edmonton Group. It rests conformably on the Eastend Formation in Saskatchewan and in the Cypress Hills area; on the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in the Drumheller area; and on the St. Mary River Formation in the Oldman River area. In southeastern Saskatchewan it is unconformably overlain by the Frenchman Formation; and in all other areas it is conformably overlain by the Battle Formation.\n\nReferences\n\nGeologic formations of Canada\nMaastrichtian Stage of North America\nCretaceous Alberta\nStratigraphy of Alberta\nStratigraphy of Saskatchewan"},

The first fair was held in December 1855 on the south side of the South Nation River. Today, the fair is held at the fair grounds in the middle of the village. These grounds contain a grandstand, race track, various show barns and a multimillion-dollar community building.\n\nThe Spencerville fair is a much-anticipated event attended by over 30,000 people annually. Attractions include the many rides and games, the Saturday parade, numerous exhibits, the giant pumpkin contest, teen and adult dances, cotton candy, bands, horse races, barbecues, midway, socials, and the fair Royalty Show, which consist of the Little Sir, Little Miss, Junior Ambassador and Ambassador competitions.\n\nThe Spencerville Agricultural Society organizes this event and is made up of numerous community volunteers. The hard work and dedication of these members, as well as the families and visitors who attend this event annually have allowed this fair to continue and prosper for 162 years.\n\nHistory \n\nIn 1854, the Leeds and Grenville County council passed a resolution granting the founding of agricultural societies within the two counties, one of which was the Township of Edwardsburg Agricultural Society (Now, Spencerville Agricultural Society). A year later, in 1855 the first fair was held on property settled by David Spencer. The following year, the fair changed locations to land donated to the society by David Spencer's daughter, Marcy Fairbairn.\n\nAccording to the fair's website, which compiled its information from the local newspaper archives and the Grenville historical society, in 1877 a delegation from Toronto visited the fair to observe how the fair operated in regards to allotting prize money and the handling of exhibits. This helped lead to the founding of the Canadian National Exhibition in 1879.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSpencerville Fair Web Site\n\nAnnual fairs\nRecurring events established in 1855\nFairs in Ontario\n1855 establishments in Canada"},

If we do not succeed this time, there is perhaps one more chance for the race left before it arrives on the banks of the Styx; and that is in the Lethe of the Pacific, which is three times as wide.'\n\nIn chapter 17 of Graham Greene's novel The Tenth Man, the protagonist Charlot watches the charlatan Carosse beguile the vulnerable Mademoiselle Mangeot: 'He knew the game so well, Charlot thought: the restless playboy knew how to offer what most people wanted more than love--peace.  The words flowed like water--the water of Lethe.'\n\nIn Stephen King's novel Rose Madder, Rose, in preparation for retrieving the title character's child from a labyrinth, is warned not to drink from the water from a river she must cross.

(IV.ii.61).\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Hamlet's father's Ghost says to the prince, 'I find thee apt, And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this.'

In his Ode to a Nightingale the narrator sinks 'Lethe-wards,' that is, into the 'drowsy numbness' of the river. \n\nThe fourth stanza of the fourth canto of Byron's 'Don Juan' reads: 'And if I laugh at any mortal thing,\n'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,\n 'T is that our nature cannot always bring\n Itself to apathy, for we must steep\n Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,\n Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:\n Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;\n A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.'\nIn his poem 'The Sleeper,' Edgar Allan Poe describes a 'sleeping' 'universal valley' that includes a Lethe-like body of water.  'Looking like Lethe, see! the lakeA conscious slumber seems to take,And would not, for the world, awake.'\n\nCharles Baudelaire's poem 'Spleen' ends with the lines 'II n'a su réchauffer ce cadavre hébétéOù coule au lieu de sang l'eau verte du Léthé' ('He failed to warm this dazed cadaver in whose veinsFlows the green water of Lethe in place of blood.'). Baudelaire also wrote a poem entitled 'Le Léthé' ('Lethe'), in which an adored but cruel woman serves as a metaphor for the oblivion of the river Lethe.\nFrench Romantic poet Alphonse de Lamartine refers to the Lethe river in 'Le Vallon' (The Vale) J'ai trop vu, trop senti, trop aimé dans ma vie;\nJe viens chercher vivant le calme du Léthé.\n(I have seen too much, felt too much, loved too much in my life;\nI come to seek, still living, the calm of Lethe.)\n\nPushkin's verse novel 'Eugene Onegin' also contains three separate references to the Lethe (Лета) including this most poignant one in Lensky's soliloquy in Chapter 6, Stanza XXII as he awaits his fate at the dueling ground:\nА я, быть может, я гробницы\nСойду в таинственную сень,\nИ память юного поэта\nПоглотит медленная Лета,\nЗабудет мир меня;\n     but I perhaps will be declining\n     into the tomb's mysterious shade;\n     the trail the youthful poet followed\n     by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,\n     and I be by the world forgot;\n\nIn Hymn to Proserpine (1866) by Algernon Charles Swinburne, the line 'We have drunken of things Lethean...' laments the decline of pagan tradition and beliefs in ancient Rome following the endorsement of Christianity as the official religion.\n\nThe river is also mentioned in at least one of the poems of Victorian classicist and poet A. E. Housman (XXIII from More Poems).\n'Crossing alone the nighted ferry\n   With the one coin for fee,\nWhom, on the wharf of Lethe waiting,\n   Count you to find? Not me.\n \nThe brisk fond lackey to fetch and carry,\n   The true, sick-hearted slave,\nExpect him not in the just city\n   And free land of the grave.'\n\nHere the role of the Lethe as the final barrier to be crossed before reaching Elysium is invoked (NB 'Lethe' is better rhyme for 'ferry' than is 'Stix') and the poem as a whole seems to reflect the associations of the Lethe with forgetfulness and escape from ones former life.\n\nThe Edna St. Vincent Millay poem 'Lethe' describes the river as 'the taker-away of pain,And the giver-back of beauty!'\nIn 'The Scarlet Woman', a poem by African-American poet Fenton Johnson (1888–1958), a young woman resorts to prostitution in order to avoid starvation. The poem concludes with the lines 'Now I can drink more gin than any man for miles around.Gin is better than all the water in Lethe.'\n\nSylvia Plath has alluded to Lethe in multiple poems, particularly in those written for Ariel. For example, both 'Amnesiac' (21 October 1962) and 'Getting There' (6 November 1962) reference the river: 'Getting There' ends with the lines 'And I, stepping from this skinOf old bandages, boredoms, old facesStep up to you from the black car of Lethe,Pure as a baby.'\nwhile the final stanza of 'Amnesiac' ends with 'O sister, mother, wife,Sweet Lethe is my life.I am never, never, never coming home!'\n\nThe river Lethe is mentioned in Allen Ginsberg's poem 'A Supermarket in California'. 'Ah, dear father graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did\nyou have when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking\nbank and stood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of\nLethe?' (Berkeley, 1955)\n\nBilly Collins, in his poem 'Forgetfulness', refers to 'a dark mythological riverwhose name begins with an L as far as you can recall'.\n\nin 'Sonnet V: To the River Downs' Charlotte Smith asks the river Lethe for forgetfulness:\n'As to the sea your limpid waves you bear, \nCan you one kind Lethean cup bestow, \nTo drink a long oblivion to my care?'\nAlso mentioned in Byron's poem 'Remember Thee! Remember Thee!'.\n\nIn the Aeneid by Vergil, in book 6 Aeneas sees the future Roman heroes drinking from the River Lethe. 'The drink the soothing fluid and long forgetfullness'\n\nEmily Dickinson mentions the 'Lethe' in her poetry (#1730 by Thomas Johnson editing).\n\nScience\nDr. William T.G. Morton, who first publicly demonstrated the use of ether as an anesthetic, called his ether 'Letheon'.\n\nTelevision\nIn the Cartoon Network series Adventure Time, the protagonists travel to the underworld in season two, episode seventeen 'Death in Bloom.'

{"id": "40226463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan%20Expo%20Denver", "title": "Fan Expo Denver", "text": "Fan Expo Denver (previously Denver Pop Culture Con and Denver Comic Con) is a speculative fiction fan convention held annually in Denver, Colorado, in the United States. The event is a celebration of comics, books, movies, TV, gaming, and other pop culture.\n\nThe non-profit organization, Pop Culture Classroom, founded the convention in 2012. After being acquired by Fan Expo HQ in 2021, the convention was renamed Fan Expo Denver.\n\nHistory\nThe inaugural convention was held June 15, 16, and 17 in 2012 with 27,700 people in attendance. Founded as Denver Comic Con, the convention was created as a program for the educational organization, Pop Culture Classroom (formally Comic Book Classroom), and funded the nonprofit’s year-round efforts.\n\nIn 2015, attendance at the event exceeded 100,000, making it one of the largest fan conventions in the United States.\n\nIn 2019, the convention’s name was changed to Denver Pop Culture Con in response to San Diego Comic-Con successfully trademarking the term “comic con.” \n\nPop Culture Classroom organized and ran the convention from 2012 to 2019. The event was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn March 2021, Fan Expo HQ acquired the convention from Pop Culture Classroom and renamed the event Fan Expo Denver. Pop Culture Classroom will remain a part of the event as its featured charity and by providing educational programs.\n\nProgramming \n\nThe convention includes celebrity panels, seminars with professional creators, actors, and artists, workshops with comic book professionals, and the Reel Heroes Independent Filmmakers Series. Elements of the convention floor include celebrity autographs, large areas like 'Artist Valley' and 'Celebrity Summit', comic book dealers and collectibles merchants, as well as fan-based organizations like the 501st Legion. Cosplayers are featured during the annual Cosplay Classic (formerly known as the 'DCC Cosplay Shindig'), the Opening Ceremonies with acts and other surprises, and associated events have included the Four Color Mixer and a genre-themed concert traditionally held at the Hard Rock Cafe Denver.\n\nAmong the distinct tracks of programming, for instance, the convention focused on comics and media featuring or produced by Colorado-area comics creators, women, minorities and the LGBTQ Community. In 2014, the conventions's Comic Book Corral (CBC) and 8-Bit Lounge gave more than 9,000 students the chance to meet artists, create comic book-themed crafts, and get hands-on experience with everything from stop-motion animated shorts to professional makeup jobs. In 2015, the Pop Culture Classroom Kids' Laboratory (PCC Kids' Lab) continued building on this success. Along with the usual mix of artist discussions, arts activities and exhibits, the PCC Lab featured activities focused around S.T.E.A.M. subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) and pop culture topics beyond comic books. They also expanded the 8-Bit Lounge to connect even more artists, educators and professionals with students ages 12–19.\n\nDates, attendance, and guests\n\nPartnerships \n\nSince the inaugural 2012 event, Breckenridge Brewery has collaborated with the convention to brew and sell a specialty beer, with the name chosen by a fan contest. The 2012 beer, an American wheat ale, was named, “The Fantastic Pour.” The 2013 beer, a Belgian Wit brewed with Buddha's Hand fruit, was dubbed 'The Caped Brewsader. The 2014 beer, an amber ale, was named 'Brews Wayne.' In 2015, “Hulk's Mash”, a pale ale brewed with mosaic hops and mango puree, was debuted. 'Snape-ricot”, an Apricot American Lager, was voted 2016's beer name, in honor of the late Alan Rickman.\n\nAurora Rise, a non-profit group founded to provide financial support to victims of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, appeared at the 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 conventions. In 2016, Denver Pridefest was partnered with the convention, and there was LGBT related content.\n\nAwards \nIn March 2013, the event was voted “Best Fan Convention” by the editors of Westword, a local alternative press publication.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n2012 establishments in Colorado\nComics conventions in the United States\nFestivals in Denver\nMultigenre conventions\nRecurring events established in 2012\nConventions in Colorado"},

He is best known for his recordings of 'I Never See Maggie Alone' and 'Choc'late Ice Cream Cone', and was a member of The Down Homers with Bill Haley.\n\nLife and career\nHe was born George S. Kingsbury Jr. in Lenoir City, Tennessee, United States, but raised on a farm outside of Greenfield, Massachusetts. He started in music at the age of 11, when he organized a band consisting entirely of young harmonica players. Later, he learned to play guitar and then bass fiddle and violin. He was inspired by Yodeling Slim Clark (with whom he performed along with the Red River Rangers from Athol, Massachusetts), as well as by Jimmie Rodgers and other singing cowboys, and was known as a blue yodeler. Roberts at age 17 won a New Hampshire radio contest to be chosen as 'Eastern States Yodeling Champion' in 1944.\n\nHe enlisted in the U.S. Navy in early 1945, then moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, after World War II ended. He performed on several shows on radio station KMOX in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as the CBS Saturday morning show, Barnyard Frolics, then organized and led a Pennsylvania-based western swing band called the Down Homers, recording for Vogue Records.\n\nRock and roll pioneer Bill Haley joined the band in 1946 as a guitarist and yodeler, replacing Roberts who had joined the Navy.  Before departing, Roberts taught Haley some of his yodels.  When Roberts returned from service, he resumed his spot with the Down Homers relieving Haley. In the early 2000s, a set of 1946 radio recordings by the Down Homers were discovered, and Haley is named and performs the solo number 'She Taught Me to Yodel.'\n\nRoberts signed a recording contract with Coral Records in 1949, a division of Decca. His first release 'I Never See Maggie Alone' was an immediate hit. It sold a million copies. He followed with other hits including 'River of Tears,' 'I've Got the Blues,' 'Yodel Polka,' 'She Taught Me to Yodel,' and 'Hillbilly Style.'\n\nHe soon began to jump while yodeling and became popular with youngsters thanks to the jumping, yodeling and his cowboy tunes. He starred in a children's TV show in 1953, performing in Cincinnati on WLW-TV. He performed on Arthur Godfrey's CBS network talent program.\n\nRoberts played at the Hoosier Hop in Fort Wayne, as well as the WCOP Hayloft Jamboree. He later performed on the Midwestern Hayride during the 1950s from Cincinnati. He became a regional star through television shows in Dayton, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana. He began a daily cartoon show on WNEM TV-5 in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1961, as The Kenny Roberts Show where he was known as 'The Yodeling Cowboy', or (according to at least one former child guest) 'The Jumping Cowboy'. The popular black-and-white show featured Roberts singing and playing guitar as he hosted children in the studio, and presented cartoons. His best known locally performed songs were 'Cheer Up, (Things Could Be Worse)' and the poignant Hank Williams tribute song 'Sing Me A Hurtin' Song' (A/B of a 45 record on Bethlehem Records). The program stayed on the air for about five years. Roberts moved back to Dayton in the early 1970s, and later, moved back to Massachusetts. He played concerts in the region, and released an album for Palomino around 1980, followed by Longhorn's 'Then and Now,' which combined historical cuts with new recordings.\n\nThough essentially retired, he continued to give concerts around the Northeast throughout the decade.\n\nRoberts died in April 2012 in Athol, Massachusetts, aged 85.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Hill Billy Music The Down Homers\n [ Kenny Roberts in AllMusic]\n\n1926 births\n2012 deaths\nAmerican country singer-songwriters\nKing Records artists\nStarday Records artists\nCoral Records artists\nPeople from Lenoir City, Tennessee\nYodelers\nPeople from Greenfield, Massachusetts\nSinger-songwriters from Tennessee\nCountry musicians from Tennessee\nUnited States Navy personnel of World War II\nSinger-songwriters from Massachusetts"},

He is best known for his satirical work and in particular his spoof diary accounts of cricket captains Andrew Strauss and Ricky Ponting. He is also the co-founder of the British humour website 7 Reasons. He currently authors the successful blog series 'Responsibilities of an adman' and lives in Fulham, London.\n\nWork\n\nSatire\nLee is perhaps best known for his work as the author of the spoof diaries of cricket captains Andrew Strauss and Ricky Ponting. The diaries entitled 'Strauss v Ponting: The Captain's Ashes Diaries' were first written during the 2009 Ashes in England. In November 2010, the second set of diaries were started in-line with the 2010/11 Ashes in Australia. After the 2009 Ashes, Lee created the spin-off character Sir Straussy. Based on Andrew Strauss, Sir Straussy writes about his time as England Cricket Captain. In October 2010, Sir Straussy was selected as the second funniest spoof account on Twitter by GQ Australia. In the past Lee has also spoofed Grace Kelly in ShortList magazine and the television and radio presenter Richard Bacon. Lee's spoofing of Bacon became a regular part of the host's BBC Radio 5 Live show in 2009.\n\n7 Reasons\nIn October 2009, Lee started the topical humour site 7 Reasons with fellow humorist and writer Marc Fearns. The two met through Richard Bacon having both proved popular guests on Bacon's Radio 5 Live show. 7 Reasons aims to provide users with seven reasons each day for a particular topic. In December 2009 the site was selected as The Best Thing To Read by The Guardian newspaper. In late 2010 the idea was being turned into a column for the UK edition of the men's magazine Esquire.\n\nIs This You?\nIs This You? is Lee's account of his three-year quest to find his best friend's look-alike. It came about after he took a photo in Sydney in 2006 that featured what Lee believed to be his best friend. His work came to light when he started doing flash-mob book readings. The book was due for release in 2010, but has been postponed while Lee concentrates on other projects.\n\nUS iPod Challenge\nWhen Lee appeared on Denmark's TV2 in August 2009, he said his next project was to travel across America 25 times in order to find out whether a claim made by iPod manufacturer Apple is correct. The claim states that it is possible to travel between New York and San Francisco 25 times without hearing the same song twice on an 80GB iPod.\n\nResponsibilities of an adman\nLee's most recent body of work is a blog concerning the advertising industry and responsibilities of its members. It is published on the professional networking site LinkedIn and although less satirical than his usual output has been generally well received. The first edition, named 'Chapter A', reached up to 11 likes. His second post however has been less popular so far, containing the word 'nipples' and describing how he stares into people's flats on his commute home.\n\nAwards\nIn October 2010, Sir Straussy was voted the second funniest spoof Twitter account by GQ Australia. The 2010/11 Strauss v Ponting Diaries were also voted the seventh funniest sports blog of 2010 by FHM and the twenty-sixth best blog of 2010 by The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nPersonal life\nLee is a keen sportsman and had county cricket trials with a number of counties. He attended Colston's Collegiate School and Bristol Grammar School before studying for a degree in design at Loughborough University. He used to work in security for The Reliance Group. In January 2011 Lee became engaged to his girlfriend who he coincidentally met through Andrew Strauss. He previously dated the Welsh singer-songwriter Duffy.\n\nNotes\nFormer Australian cricketer Michael Slater was reprimanded by Channel 9 after quoting Sir Straussy during the channel's coverage of the Boxing Day Test Match between Australia and Pakistan in 2009. Slater publicised Sir Straussy's Twitter address which is against the code of conduct issued by Channel 9.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n 7 Reasons\n Lee's Blog\n Strauss v Ponting: The Captain's Ashes Diaries\n\nLiving people\nAlumni of Loughborough University\nBritish comedians\nBritish male journalists\nBritish satirists\nPeople from Fulham\nPeople from Loughborough\nYear of birth missing (living people)"},

{"id": "20352309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binturong", "title": "Binturong", "text": "The binturong (Arctictis binturong) (, ), also known as the bearcat, is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. It is uncommon in much of its range, and has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% since the mid 1980s. The binturong is the only living species in the genus Arctictis.\n\nTaxonomy \nViverra binturong was the scientific name used by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822 for a binturong collected in Malacca. The scientific name of the genus Arctictis was coined by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824. Arctictis is a monotypic taxon; its morphology is similar to that of members of the genera Paradoxurus and Paguma.\n\nEtymology \nThe name Arctictis means 'bear-weasel', from Greek arkt- 'bear' + iktis 'weasel'. In Riau, Indonesia it is called 'benturong' and 'tenturun'.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe binturong is long and heavy, with short, stout legs. It has a thick coat of coarse black hair. The bushy and prehensile tail is thick at the root, gradually tapering, and curls inwards at the tip. The muzzle is short and pointed, somewhat turned up at the nose, and is covered with bristly hairs, brown at the points, which lengthen as they diverge, and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face. The eyes are large, black and prominent. The ears are short, rounded, edged with white, and terminated by tufts of black hair. There are six short rounded incisors in each jaw, two canines, which are long and sharp, and six molars on each side. The hair on the legs is short and of a yellowish tinge. The feet are five-toed, with large strong claws; the soles are bare, and applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length; the hind ones are longer than the fore ones.\n\nIn general build the binturong is essentially like Paradoxurus and Paguma, but more massive in the length of the tail, legs and feet, in the structure of the scent glands and larger size of the rhinarium, which is more convex with a median groove being much narrower above the philtrum. The contour hairs of the coat are much longer and coarser, and the long hairs clothing the whole of the back of the ears project beyond the tip as a definite tuft. The anterior bursa flap of the ears is more widely and less deeply emarginate. The tail is more muscular, especially at the base, and in colour generally like the body, but commonly paler at the base beneath. The body hairs are frequently partly whitish or buff, giving a speckled appearance to the pelage, sometimes so pale that the whole body is mostly straw-coloured or grey, the young being often at all events paler than the adults, but the head is always closely speckled with grey or buff. The long mystacial vibrissae are conspicuously white, and there is a white rim on the summit of the otherwise black ear. The glandular area is whitish.\n\nThe tail is nearly as long as the head and body, which ranges from ; the tail is  long. Some captive binturongs measured from  to  in head and body with a tail of . Mean weight of captive adult females is  with a range from . Captive animals often weigh more than wild counterparts. 12 captive female binturongs were found to weigh a mean of  while 22 males weighed a mean of . The estimated mean weight of wild females per one study was . However, seven wild male binturongs in Thailand were found to weigh a mean of , while one female was of similar weight at . One estimate of the mean body mass of wild binturongs was . The binturong appears to be the largest species of the viverrid family, rivaled only by the African civet, which weighs a mean of about .\n\nBoth sexes have scent glands; females on either side of the vulva, and males between the scrotum and penis. The musk glands emit an odor reminiscent of popcorn or corn chips, likely due to the volatile compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in the urine, which is also produced in the Maillard reaction at high temperatures. Unlike most other carnivorans, the male binturong does not have a baculum.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe binturong occurs from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan in China, and Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java in Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines.\nIt is confined to tall forest.\nIn Assam, it is common in foothills and hills with good tree cover, but less so in the forested plains. It has been recorded in Manas National Park, in Dulung and Kakoi Reserved Forests of the Lakhimpur district, in the hill forests of Karbi Anglong, North Cachar Hills, Cachar and Hailakandi Districts.\nIn Myanmar, binturongs were photographed on the ground in Tanintharyi Nature Reserve at an elevation of , in the Hukaung Valley at elevations from , in the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve at  and at three other sites up to  elevation.\nIn Thailand's Khao Yai National Park, several individuals were observed feeding in a fig tree and on a vine.\nIn Laos, they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest.\nIn Malaysia, binturongs were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that was logged in the 1970s.\nIn Palawan, it inhabits primary and secondary lowland forest, including grassland–forest mosaic from sea level to .\n\nTaxonomy\nViverra binturong was the scientific name proposed by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822 for a specimen from Malacca. The generic name Arctictis was proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the following zoological specimens were described:\nParadoxurus albifrons proposed by Frédéric Cuvier in 1822 was based on a drawing of a binturong from Bhutan prepared by Alfred Duvaucel.\nArctictis penicillata by Temminck in 1835 were specimens from Sumatra and Java.\nArctictis whitei proposed by Joel Asaph Allen in 1910 were skins of two female binturongs collected in Palawan Island in the Philippines.\nArctictis pageli proposed by Ernst Schwarz in 1911 was a skin and skull of a female collected in northern Borneo.\nArctictis gairdneri proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1916 was a skull of a male binturong collected in southwestern Thailand.\nArctictis niasensis proposed by Marcus Ward Lyon Jr. in 1916 was a binturong skin from Nias Island.\nA. b. kerkhoveni by Henri Jacob Victor Sody in 1936 was based on specimens from Bangka Island.\nA. b. menglaensis by Wang and Li in 1987 was based on specimens from the Yunnan Province in China.\n\nNine subspecies have been recognized forming two clades. The northern clade in mainland Asia is separated from the Sundaic clade by the Isthmus of Kra.\n\nEcology and behavior\n\nThe binturong is active during the day and at night. Three sightings in Pakke Tiger Reserve were by day. Thirteen camera trap photograph events in Myanmar involved one around dusk, seven in full night and five in broad daylight. All photographs were of single animals, and all were taken on the ground. As binturongs are not very nimble, they may have to descend to the ground relatively frequently when moving between trees.\n\nFive radio-collared binturongs in the Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary exhibited an arrhythmic activity dominated by crepuscular and nocturnal tendencies with peaks in the early morning and late evening. Reduced inactivity periods occurred from midday to late afternoon. They moved between  and  daily in the dry season and increased their daily movement to  in the wet season. Ranges sizes of males varied between  and . Two males showed slightly larger ranges in the wet season. Their ranges overlapped between 30 and 70%. The average home range of a radio-collared female in the Khao Yai National Park was estimated at , and the one of a male at .\n\nThe binturong is essentially arboreal. Pocock observed the behaviour of several captive individuals in the London Zoological Gardens. When resting they lie curled up, with the head tucked under the tail. They seldom leaped, but climbed skillfully, albeit slowly, progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branches or, upside down, beneath them. The prehensile tail was always ready as a help. They descended the vertical bars of the cage head first, gripping them between their paws and using the prehensile tail as a check. When irritated they growled fiercely. When on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunts or a hissing sound made by expelling air through partially opened lips.\n\nThe binturong uses its tail to communicate.\nIt moves about gently, often coming to a stop, and often using the tail to keep balance, clinging to a branch. It shows a pronounced comfort behaviour associated with grooming the fur, shaking and licking the hair, and scratching. Shaking is the most characteristic element of comfort behaviour.\n\nThe species is normally quite shy, but aggressive when harassed. It is reported to initially urinate or defecate on a threat and then, if teeth-baring and snarling does not deter the threat, it uses its powerful jaws and teeth in self-defense. When threatened, the binturong will usually flee into a nearby tree, but as a defense mechanism the binturong may sometimes balance on its tail and flash its claws to appear threatening to potential predators. Predation on adult binturong is reportedly quite rare by sympatric species like the leopard, clouded leopard and reticulated python.\n\nDiet \nThe binturong is omnivorous, feeding on small mammals, birds, fish, earthworms, insects and fruits. It also preys on rodents. Fish and earthworms are likely unimportant items in its diet, as it is neither aquatic nor fossorial, coming across such prey only when opportunities present themselves. Since it does not have the attributes of a predatory mammal, most of the binturong's diet is probably of vegetable matter. Figs are a major component of its diet. Captive binturongs are particularly fond of plantains, but also eat fowls' heads and eggs.\n\nThe binturong is an important agent for seed dispersal, especially for those of the strangler fig, because of its ability to scarify the seed's tough outer covering.\n\nIn captivity, the binturong's diet includes commercially prepared meat mix, bananas, apples, oranges, canned peaches and mineral supplement.\n\nReproduction\nThe average age of sexual maturation is 30.4 months for females and 27.7 months for males. The estrous cycle of the binturong lasts 18 to 187 days, with an average of 82.5 days. Gestation lasts 84 to 99 days. Litter size in captivity varies from one to six young, with an average of two young per birth. Neonates weigh between , and are often referred to as . Fertility lasts until 15 years of age.\n\nThe maximum known lifespan in captivity is thought to be over 25 years of age.\n\nThreats\n\nMajor threats to the binturong are habitat loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses throughout the binturong's range. Habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands of the Sundaic part of its range, and there is no evidence that the binturong uses the plantations that are largely replacing natural forest. In China, rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging practices have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether. In the Philippines, it is captured for the wildlife trade, and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption. In Laos, it is one of the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane. In parts of Laos, it is considered a delicacy and also traded as a food item to Vietnam.\n\nThe Orang Asli of Malaysia has the tradition of keeping binturongs as pets.\n\nConservation \nIndia included the binturong in CITES Appendix III and in Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act 1973, so that it has the highest level of protection. In China, it is listed as critically endangered. It is completely protected  in Bangladesh, and partially in Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Licensed hunting of binturong is allowed in Indonesia, and it is not protected in Brunei.\n\nWorld Binturong Day, an event dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation, takes place yearly every second Saturday of May.\n\nIn captivity \n\nBinturongs are common in zoos, and captive individuals represent a source of genetic diversity essential for long-term conservation. Their geographic origin is either usually unknown, or they are offspring of several generations of captive-bred animals.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n\nViverrids\nCarnivorans of Asia\nMammals of Bangladesh\nMammals of Bhutan\nMammals of China\nMammals of India\nMammals of Southeast Asia\nCarnivorans of Malaysia\nVulnerable fauna of Asia\nMammals described in 1821"},

Bent authored several books and articles, many critiquing the practices of newspapers in their reporting. He was married to Elizabeth Sims.\n\nCareer \nBent began his newspaper work in 1900 in Louisville, Kentucky, working for the Louisville Herald. After three years he moved to St. Louis and joined the staff of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as reporter and assistant editor. He was appointed assistant professor of theory and practice of journalism at the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri when the school was opened in 1908, but resigned his position in February 1909 to return to the Post-Dispatch.

{"id": "14627005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisnevich%20topology", "title": "Nisnevich topology", "text": "In algebraic geometry, the Nisnevich topology, sometimes called the completely decomposed topology, is a Grothendieck topology on the category of schemes which has been used in algebraic K-theory, A¹ homotopy theory, and the theory of motives.  It was originally introduced by Yevsey Nisnevich, who was motivated by the theory of adeles.\n\nDefinition \nA morphism of schemes  is called a Nisnevich morphism if it is an étale morphism such that for every (possibly non-closed) point x ∈ X, there exists a point y ∈ Y in the fiber  such that the induced map of residue fields k(x) → k(y) is an isomorphism.  Equivalently, f must be flat, unramified,  locally of finite presentation, and for every point x ∈ X, there must exist a point y in the fiber  such that k(x) → k(y) is an isomorphism.\n\nA family of morphisms {uα : Xα → X} is a Nisnevich cover if each morphism in the family is étale and for every (possibly non-closed) point x ∈ X, there exists α and a point y ∈ Xα s.t. uα(y) = x and the induced map of residue fields k(x) → k(y) is an isomorphism. If the family is finite, this is equivalent to the morphism  from  to X being a Nisnevich morphism.  The Nisnevich covers are the covering families of a pretopology on the category of schemes and morphisms of schemes.  This generates a topology called the Nisnevich topology.  The category of schemes with the Nisnevich topology is notated Nis.\n\nThe small Nisnevich site of X  has as underlying category the same as the small étale site, that is to say, objects are schemes U with a fixed étale morphism U → X and the morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to X. Admissible coverings are Nisnevich morphisms.\n\nThe big Nisnevich site of X  has  as underlying category  schemes with a fixed map to X and morphisms the morphisms of X-schemes. The topology is the one given by Nisnevich morphisms.\n\nThe Nisnevich topology has several variants which are adapted to studying singular varieties.  Covers in these topologies include resolutions of singularities or weaker forms of resolution.\n The cdh topology allows proper birational morphisms as coverings.\n The h topology allows De Jong's alterations as coverings.\n The l′ topology allows morphisms as in the conclusion of Gabber's local uniformization theorem.\nThe cdh and l′ topologies are incomparable with the étale topology, and the h topology is finer than the étale topology.\n\nEquivalent conditions for a Nisnevich cover \nAnother equivalent conditionpg 21 for a family of morphisms  of schemes to be a Nisnevich covering is if\n\n Every  is etale\n The coproduct of the induced maps  on their associated functors gives a surjective map of sets for a field .\n\nThere is an alternative characterization using finite sequences of finitely presented closed subschemeswhere the second condition is replaced with the hypothesis thatadmits a section. Notice that when evaluating these morphisms on -points, this implies the map is a surjection. Conversely, taking the trivial sequence  gives the result in the opposite direction.\n\nMotivation \nOne of the key motivations for introducing the Nisnevich topology in motivic cohomology is the fact that a Zariski open cover  does not yield a resolution of Zariski sheaveswhereis the representable functor over the category of presheaves with transfers. For the Nisnevich topology, the local rings are Henselian, and a finite cover of a Henselian ring is given by a product of Henselian rings, showing exactness.\n\nLocal rings in the Nisnevich topology \n\nIf x is a point of a scheme X, then the local ring of x in the Nisnevich topology is the Henselization of the local ring of x in the Zariski topology. This differs from the Etale topology where the local rings are strict henselizations. One of the important points between the two cases can be seen when looking at a local ring  with residue field . In this case, the residue fields of the Henselization and strict Henselization differso the residue field of the strict Henselization gives the separable closure of the original residue field .\n\nExamples of Nisnevich Covering \nConsider the étale cover given by\n\nIf we look at the associated morphism of residue fields for the generic point of the base, we see that this is a degree 2 extension\n\nThis implies that this étale cover is not Nisnevich. We can add the étale morphism  to get a Nisnevich cover since there is an isomorphism of points for the generic point of .\n\nConditional covering \nIf we take  as a scheme over a field , then a coveringpg 21 given bywhere  is the inclusion and , then this covering is Nisnevich if and only if  has a solution over . Otherwise, the covering cannot be a surjection on -points. In this case, the covering is only an Etale covering.\n\nZariski coverings \nEvery Zariski coveringpg 21 is Nisnevich but the converse doesn't hold in general. This can be easily proven using any of the definitions since the residue fields will always be an isomorphism regardless of the Zariski cover, and by definition a Zariski cover will give a surjection on points. In addition, Zariski inclusions are always Etale morphisms.\n\nApplications \nNisnevich introduced his topology to provide a cohomological interpretation of the class set of an affine group scheme, which was originally defined in adelic terms.  He used it to partially prove a conjecture of Alexander Grothendieck and Jean-Pierre Serre which states that a rationally trivial torsor under a reductive group scheme over an integral regular Noetherian base scheme is locally trivial in the Zariski topology.  One of the key properties of the Nisnevich topology is the existence of a descent spectral sequence. Let X be a Noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension, and let Gn(X) be the Quillen K-groups of the category of coherent sheaves on X. If  is the sheafification of these groups with respect to the Nisnevich topology,  there is a convergent spectral sequence\n\nfor , , and .  If  is a prime number not equal to the characteristic of X, then there is an analogous convergent spectral sequence for K-groups with coefficients in .\n\nThe Nisnevich topology has also found important applications in algebraic K-theory, A¹ homotopy theory and the theory of motives.\n\nSee also \n\n Presheaf with transfers\n Mixed motives (math)\n A¹ homotopy theory\n Henselian ring\n\nReferences \n\n , available at Nisnevich's website\n\n \n\nAlgebraic geometry\nTopos theory"},

{"id": "15334892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festa%20della%20Repubblica", "title": "Festa della Repubblica", "text": "Festa della Repubblica (; English: Republic Day) is the Italian National Day and Republic Day, which is celebrated on 2 June each year, with the main celebration taking place in Rome. The Festa della Repubblica is one of the national symbols of Italy.\n\nThe day commemorates the institutional referendum held by universal suffrage in 1946, in which the Italian people were called to the polls to decide on the form of government following the Second World War and the fall of Fascism.\n\nThe ceremony of the event, organized in Rome, includes the deposition of a laurel wreath as a tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier at the Altare della Patria by the President of the Italian Republic and a military parade along Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome.\n\nHistory\n\nOn the 2nd and 3rd of June of 1946, an institutional referendum was held with which the Italians were called to the polls to decide which form of state – monarchy or republic – to give to the country. The referendum was announced at the end of World War II, a few years after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, the dictatorial regime that had been supported by the Italian royal family, the House of Savoy, for more than 20 years.\n\nThe supporters of the republic chose the symbol of the Italia turrita, the national personification of Italy, to be used in the electoral campaign and on the referendum card on the institutional form of the State, in contrast to the Savoy coat of arms which represented the monarchy. This triggered various controversies, given that the iconography of the allegorical personification of Italy had, and still has, a universal and unifying meaning that should have been common to all Italians and not only to a part of them: this was the last appearance in the institutional context of turreted Italy.\n\nThis institutional referendum was the first vote by universal suffrage in Italy. The result of the popular consultation, 12,717,923 votes for the republic and 10,719,284 for the monarchy (with a percentage, respectively, of 54.3% and 45.7%), was communicated on 10 June 1946, when the Court of Cassation declared, after 85 years of the Kingdom of Italy, the birth of the Italian Republic, being definitively sanctioned on 18 June.\n\nThe King of Italy, Umberto II of Savoy, decided to leave Italy on 13 June to avoid the clashes between monarchists and Republicans, already manifested in bloody events in various Italian cities, for fear they could extend throughout the country. He went into exile in Portugal. From 1 January 1948, with the entry into force of the Constitution of the Italian Republic, the male descendants of Umberto II of Savoy were banned from entering Italy; the provision being repealed in 2002. 11 June 1946, the first day of republican Italy, was declared a public holiday.\n\nOn 2 June the birth of the modern nation is celebrated in a similar way to the French 14 July (anniversary of the storming of the Bastille) and to the 4th July in the United States (anniversary of the declaration of independence from Great Britain). The unity of Italy and the birth of the Italian state is celebrated on 17 March, in honor of 17 March 1861, the date of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy. Before the birth of the republic, the national celebratory day of the Kingdom of Italy was the feast of the Statuto Albertino, which was held on the first Sunday of June.\n\nThe first celebration of the Festa della Repubblica took place on 2 June 1947, while in 1948 there was the first parade in Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome; June 2 was definitively declared a national holiday in 1949. On this occasion the ceremonial included the past review of the armed forces in honor of the republic by the President of the Italian Republic; the demonstration took place in Piazza Venezia, opposite the Altare della Patria. After the deposition of the laurel crown to the Italian Unknown Soldier by the President of the Italian Republic Luigi Einaudi, the banners of the armed forces abandoned the formation, they walked the stairway of the monument and paid homage to the president with a bow.\n\nIn 1949, with the entry of Italy into NATO, ten celebrations took place simultaneously throughout the country: on the occasion, to highlight the bond of the newly formed republic with Mazzinianism, current of the Risorgimento which was headed by Giuseppe Mazzini, fervent Republican, a celebratory monument was inaugurated in the current Piazzale Ugo La Malfa in Rome, in memory of the Genoese patriot, in front of which the main event of the Festa della Repubblica took place.\n\nIn 1961 the main celebration of the Festa della Repubblica did not take place in Rome but in Turin, the first capital of a united Italy. Turin was the capital of Italy from 1861 to 1865, followed by Florence (1865–1871) and finally by Rome, which is its capital since 1871. In 1961, in fact, was also celebrated the centenary of the unification of Italy (1861–1961). In 1963 the demonstration was not carried out on June 2 for the health conditions of Pope John XXIII, now dying, and was postponed to 4 November, simultaneously with National Unity and Armed Forces Day.\n\nIn 1965 the banners of the suppressed military units that took part in the World War I also participated in the main celebration of Rome; in that year the 50th anniversary of Italy's entry into the First World War was also commemorated. Specifically, Italy officially began military operations in World War I on 24 May 1915, with a first cannon shot fired by Fort Verena, on the Asiago plateau, towards the Austrian fortresses located on the Vezzena Plain: to the first infantry of the Royal Italian Army that crossed the border is dedicated the first stanza of La Leggenda del Piave.\n\nDue to the severe economic crisis that gripped Italy in the 1970s, to contain state and social costs, the Festa della Repubblica, with law n. 54 of 5 March 1977, was moved to the first Sunday of June, with the consequent suppression of 2 June as a public holiday connected to it. In 2001, on the impulse of the then President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who was the protagonist, at the beginning of the 21st century, of a more general action to promote national symbols of Italy, the Festa della Repubblica has abandoned the status of a moveable feast, summarizing its traditional location of 2 June, which has now returned to being a holiday in all respects.\n\nCelebration\n\nThe official ceremony of the Rome celebration includes the solemn flag-raising ceremony at the Altare della Patria and the tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier with the deposition of a laurel wreath by the President of the Italian Republic in the presence of the highest offices of the State, or of the President of the Senate, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Council of Ministers, the President of the Constitutional Court, the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Defense. After the playing of the National Anthem Il Canto degli Italiani, the Frecce Tricolori cross the skies of Rome.\n\nFollowing the ceremony the President is then driven to Via di San Gregorio with the presidential Lancia Flaminia escorted by a patrol group of Corazzieri on a motorcycle where, together with the military commander of the capital garrison, usually a Major General, he reviews the parade formations presenting arms as the bands play their service or inspection marches. The Head of State then processes to the presidential tribune which is located in Via dei Fori Imperiali, gets down the vehicle, and processes there to meet other dignitaries and as he arrives in his spot in the dais the Corazzieri's mounted troopers, which had provided the rear escort during the review phrase, salute the President as the anthem is played.It is tradition, for the members of the Italian government and for the presidents of the two chambers of parliament, to have pinned on the jacket, during the whole ceremony, an Italian tricolor cockade. Following the anthem, the parade begins, which the ground columns of military personnel saluting the President with eyes left or right with their colours dipped as they march past the dais. Mobile column crew contingent colour guards perform the salute in like manner.\n\nThe ceremony concludes in the afternoon with the opening to the public of the gardens of the Quirinal Palace, seat of the Presidency of the Italian Republic, and with musical performances by the bands of the Italian Army, the Italian Navy, and the Italian Air Force, of the Carabinieri, of the Polizia di Stato, of the Guardia di Finanza, of the Polizia Penitenziaria and of the State Forestry Corps.\n\nOn the feast day, at the Palazzo del Quirinale, the Changing of the Guard with the Corazzieri Regiment and the Fanfare of the Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment in high uniform is carried out in solemn form. This solemn rite is only performed on two other occasions, during the celebrations of the Tricolour Day (7 January) and the National Unity and Armed Forces Day (4 November).\n\nOfficial ceremonies are held throughout the national territory. Among them are the traditional receptions organized by each prefecture for the local authorities, which are preceded by solemn public demonstrations with reduced military parades that have been reviewed by the prefect in his capacity as the highest governmental authority in the province. Similar ceremonies are also organized by the Regions and Municipalities.\n\nAll over the world, Italian embassies organize ceremonies to which the Heads of State of the host country are invited. Greetings from the other Heads of State reach the President of the Italian Republic from all over the world.\n\nParade\n\nAll the Italian Armed Forces, all the police forces of the Republic, the Vigili del Fuoco, the Protezione Civile and the Italian Red Cross take part in the military parade. The military parade was included for the first time in the protocol of official celebrations in 1950.\n\nIn 1976 the military parade was not organized following the disastrous earthquake of Friuli, while the following year, in 1977, in full austerity, it was decided not to resume the traditional military parade to avoid burdening further expenses on the state budget. This decision was also reiterated in the following years. Instead of the military parade, a demonstration was organized in Piazza Venezia, which was attended by representatives of the Italian armed forces.\n\nThe military parade was reinserted in the official ceremony of the main celebration of Rome in 1983; in that year the Festa della Repubblica was organized on the first Sunday of June, which was the 5th, between the Aventine and Porta San Paolo to commemorate the Resistance to the German occupation of the city of Rome during the World War II. The following year, in 1984, the parade returned to Via dei Fori Imperiali, while in 1985 it took place between Via dei Cerchi and the Baths of Caracalla. In 1989 the military parade was eliminated again; in its place a historical exhibition was organized in Piazza di Siena in Rome. Until 1999, the celebration of the Festa della Repubblica was limited exclusively to the ceremony at the Altare della Patria.\n\nThe parade returned permanently to the ceremony in 2000 on the initiative of the then President of the Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In 2004, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi granted a special privillege to the municipal police corps of Rome, representing all the local Italian police, and the Protezione Civile personnel to take part in the parade in honor of their services to the country and their communities.\n\nThe military parade also includes some military delegations from the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and representatives of multinational departments with an Italian component. One of the most awaited parts of the celebrations, the parade is saluted by the President in his or her capacity as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nBrief summary of the parade segment \nAs earlier stated the parade begins with the playing of the National Anthem as troopers of the Corazzieri salute the President. After the troopers march off the grandstand, the parade begins as the Central National Band of the Carabinieri marches past the dais, the first band of the parade, to herald the official arrival of the parade commander, usually a Major General of the Army, who drives past the grandstand with his motorized escort, followed by a motorized colour guard. Veterans contingents in vehicles from the Armed Forces, all police forces and the Vigili del Fuoco follow the command contingent.\n\nThese personnel are followed by the ground contingent, made up of personnel of the Armed Forces, all police forces, Civil Protection and civil service personnel.

{"id": "65714507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%20William%20Wall", "title": "Arthur William Wall", "text": "Arthur William Horace Wall (also known as Horace) (21 October 1874 - ?) was an engineer in the field of motorised transport and inventor of the self-powered wheel in England in the early 20th century. He is best known for his creation of the self-powered wheel, the Wall Autowheel, which could be used to power a bicycle, but he was also the man behind Roc motorcycles and a tricar and four-wheel cyclecar. His main company was A.W. Wall Ltd, but he created several other companies (or subsidiaries) to compartmentalise his different activities, such as the Roc Gear Co, who supplied epicyclic gears to a significant number of manufacturers before WW1.\n\nROC Motorcycles \nBy the early 1900s, Horace noticed the rise in bicycles in the United Kingdom which was a market he wanted to tap into. One of the earliest products of A.W. Wall Ltd launched at the Stanley Show in 1903, this unusually long and low motorcycle with a 3 hp engine had initially been used a Kelecom engine, but also was used to promote the ROC epicyclic hub gearboxes and clutches produced by ROC Gear Co. (another A.W.Wall firm). Kelecom merged with Ormonde in 1904, but the combined company failed later that year and the remaining assets was taken over by Taylor Gue, so the engine supplier must have changed. Most likely candidates were J.A.P. and F.E. Baker Ltd (maker of 'Precision' engines), and the latter had certainly been adopted by 1913 and were used exclusively in the motor tricycle.\n\nThe ROC Motorcycle had a celebrity backer in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and in 1905 it was announced he had entered a motorcycle in the International Cup race and would nominate a rider to ride it for him.\n\nIn mid-1907 A.W.Wall Ltd revealed details of the patent Roc free engine clutch and hub gear, an epicyclic gear constantly in-mesh. Later that year, at the 1907 Crystal Palace show, Roc exhibited two models, a 4 hp single and a 5 hp twin, both fitted with Roc patent clutch. There was also a military version of the ROC motorcycle mentioned in 1907 and available as a 4HP single or a 5-6HP twin in 1909. This had the characteristic long low frame, with large ROC hub gear, and also the new ROC patent duplex sprung front forks.\n\nAt the 1908 Stanley show two motorcycles were shown, the 4 hp single (83mm bore by 90mm stroke) and a new 5-6HP V-twin (75mm bore, 80mm stroke), both of these models now had mechanically operated inlet valves. Also shown as available for 1909 was the Roc 2-speed hub gear conversion 'to fit practically every motorcycle'. At the 1909 show they continued with their single and twin, but added a 6HP four cylinder motorcycle with pressed steel frame, with prop shaft drive.\n\nAt the 1913 Olympia Show 3 models were shown, the 6HP twin with Precision engine, and 4.5HP single, and a lightweight 2.75HP with a lightweight ROC gearbox. The 4.5HP model had a new four-speed gear with internal expanding clutch.\n\nOther motorcycles licensed Roc equipment, for example in 1911 the Humber 3.5HP 2-speed motorcycle was listed as having 'Roc Patents'. The Rex and the A.C. Sociable tricar also used the Roc patent gear.\n\nWall Autowheel \n\nHorris patented the autowheel concept in 1908 (GB190823080), and in November 1909 it was launched at the annual Stanley Show, and caused quite a sensation. Weighing 25 lbs the price was £15 5s. This first model was a 2-stroke of about 90cc. While it gathered a great deal of publicity, unfortunately it didn't appear on the market. In July 1910 it was explained that this was due to it not yet being perfected and that while many orders were received 'deliveries were being kept back until the invention could be further experimented with' with the result that 'very few have been put on the road'.\n\nBy the time of the November Motor Cycle show in 1910 (this time held at Olympia) the design was said to have been perfected (with assistance from Messrs Humber Limited), and a show review reported that it is 'now made by the Humber Company'. However this too seemed to be premature, and it was still being perfected and improved in March 1912. The latest version was shown at the November 1912 show at Olympia, and by early 1913 it was in production under a new company, the International Auto-Wheel Company Ltd of Russell Road, London.\n\nDuring the long stage of 'perfecting' the Auto-Wheel it had evolved into a four-stroke of 118cc (bore 2.125in, stroke 2.5in) with automatic inlet valve and in this form the Wall Autowheel was finally to become a success. In addition to home production (opinions vary as to whether all production was under licence by BSA), it was also licensed to other companies in France, Belgium and Holland and in the United States to A.O. Smith of Milwaukee, who even used it to power a buckboard known as the Smith Flyer, with the rights to this in turn passed to Briggs & Stratton, who made a buckboard known as the 'Red Bug'.\n\nAt the 1913 Olympia Show, it was announced that 1914 production was to be 5000 in house, and a further 5000 under licence to BSA. However, with the advent of WW1 production ceased, and while it remained advertised on sale by agents into 1915, it was likely these were items in stock.\n\nAfter WW1 it appeared briefly as the power unit for the Silva Scooter.\n\nWall Tricar \nA.W.Wall Ltd introduced the ROC motor tricycle at the Olympia Show in 1910. It was described as having an 'ornate coach-built body resembling a giant Easter Egg, which is set in an open pressed-steel frame'. When it went into production in 1911 (in Tyseley, Birmingham) it had a sidecar type body, and has been described as more like an elaborate motorcycle and sidecar rather than a true cyclecar. The air-cooled engine drove a live rear axle through a clutch, gearbox and drive-shaft. Later models adopted a strong tubular frame, seating two side by side. It originally had tiller steering though this was replaced by wheel steering in 1914. Two models were built using F.E. Baker Ltd Precision air-cooled engines, one with a 6HP twin cylinder and the other with a 4.5HP single cylinder. At the 1913 Olympia Show it was said that the 4.5HP tricars were presented in several forms, mainly for goods carrying, but there was also a 2 seater with an 8HP air-cooled Precision engine.\n\nManufacture ceased in 1915.\n\nWall Cyclecar \nIn 1912, Arthur Wall revealed his latest creation, a four-wheel cyclecar. Two models were to be built with the same combination of engines as used on the Tricar. Unlike many cyclecars, the transmission was via propshaft with universal joint to a live rear axle. The twin has a two-speed (and reverse) Roc epicyclic gearbox (Roc Gear Co of Hay Mills, Birmingham was also an A.W. Walls company).  A new company, Wall Cars Ltd of Tyselely, Birmingham had been created to produce the cars.\n\nReferences\n\n1874 births\nDefunct motorcycle manufacturers of the United Kingdom\nCyclecars\n20th-century British engineers\nYear of death missing"},

{"id": "39104407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish%20poetry%20from%20al-Andalus", "title": "Jewish poetry from al-Andalus", "text": "The golden age of Jewish poetry in Al-Andalus developed in the literary courts of the various taifas. Like its Arabic counterpart, its production diminished in the 12th century under the rule of the Almoravids and Almohads. In the last part of the 10th century, Dunash ben Labrat revolutionized Jewish poetry in Al-Andalus by bringing Arabic meter and monorhyme into Hebrew writing. Jewish poets employed Arabic poetic themes, writing bacchic poetry, garden poetry, and love poetry.\n\nLiterary language \n\nAs in the rest of the Arabic world at the time, Arabic was the typical language for Jewish writing, except for sacred religious texts and belles lettres.  Practically all Jewish works about philosophy, theology, mathematics, were written in Arabic, typically in Hebrew characters. This type of writing has been called Judeo-Arabic, although there was little difference in the language used by Jews and non-Jews at this time. The choice of Hebrew as the poetic language can be seen as an expression of Jewish self-assertion. Contemporary Arabic poets considered their language, the language of the Qur'an, the most beautiful language, and Arabic verse as the highest form of poetry; Jewish poets thought similarly of their sacred writings and composed poetry in Biblical Hebrew Apart from Dunash's metrical innovations, the Hebrew of these poems tried to emulate the diction and style of Classical Hebrew, abolishing elements that had been introduced into the language after the canonization of the Hebrew Bible. This classical approach was facilitated by advances in the study of Hebrew grammar and biblical interpretation.\n\nHebrew liturgical poetry \n\nThe Tanakh contains several poetic sections, including the Song of the sea and the Song of Deborah, as well as poetic books such as the Book of Psalms and the Book of Job. The Talmud also includes a number of poetic sections. Piyyut had flourished in Byzantine Palestine between the fifth and seventh centuries. The incorporation of the complex and opaque poetry of the piyyutim required the recognition of an unusual vocabulary, foreign words, complex grammatical forms, and a great number of allusions to Jewish religious sources.\n\nCaliphate of Córdoba \n\nIn the late 10th century, Dunash ben Labrat, a North African rabbi and student of Saadia Gaon, arrived at the Caliphate of Córdoba and revolutionized Hebrew poetry in al-Ándalus.  Dunash designed a system of short and long vowels for Hebrew that allowed it to imitate Arabic meter, and adopted the structure of the qasida. Practically all Judeo-Spanish poets adopted Dunash's innovations. Moses ibn Ezra said that the best Hebrew poetry was composed according to the Arabic model, but Yehudah Halevi, a contemporary of ibn Ezra, felt ambivalent toward the metric innovations, condemning them as a cultural surrender.\n\nGolden age of Judeo-Spanish poetry \n\nThe division of the caliphate into taifas, and the subsequent literary courts in various taifas, brought a golden age to Judeo-Spanish poetry. Notable poets of this period include Semuel ibn Nagrella (993-1056), Salomón ibn Gabirol (1021-1055), Moses ibn Ezra (1055-1138), Yehudah Halevi (1074-1141), Yishaq ibn Gayyat (1038-1089), and Abraham ibn Ezra (1092-1167). These poets were particularly influenced by Middle Eastern Arabic poets such as al-Mutanabbi and Abu Tammam, rather than by Andalusians poets.  Many shared al-Mutanabbi's elitism toward a society that wasn't interested in their poetry. Love poetry, following the Arabic tradition, was inspired by the work of Abu Nuwas. Themes included beauty and longing, unrequited love, the pleasures of wine or naseeb, as well as the love obstacles of Hejazi poetry. A number of medieval Hebrew songs glorify the beauty of boys, particularly between the 11th and early 13th centuries. As with Arabic poetry, the production of Jewish poetry diminished under the reign of the Almoravids and the Almohads from the 12th century onwards.\n\nMeters and genres \n\nThe qasida was typical for major poetic genres. The madih praised and honored a great man, while the martiyya or ritza commemorated the death of a great man. The satirical hiya or hichá ridiculed enemies, although this form is much more prominent in Arabic poetry.\n\nPoets also adopted the Muwashshah, a strophic form typically devoted to issues related to the pleasures of life, descriptions of wine and its consumption, love or expressions of regret for the ephemeral nature of these pleasures. The Kharja, or final refrain of these muwashshahat typically switched from classical Arabic to colloquial Andalusian Arabic.  In Hebrew poems, the change was between different languages—from Hebrew to Arabic or a Romance language like Judaeo-Spanish - a testament to the trilingual society Andalusian Jews lived in. As for themes, Jewish poetry, which had previously centered on the liturgical, became very similar to the Arabic tradition. By the tenth century, Arabic culture had developed a rich and varied poetic tradition. Jewish poets used the nostalgic tone of poetry of the Arabian Desert for poems about their own exile; imitated the Bacchic poems that described the pleasures of wine and sheltered gardens, and reflected on the lifestyle of a well-to-do class that shared values with their Muslim peers. They also shared an interest in Neo-Platonic concepts about the soul and other themes of Arabic love poetry, reformulated through the language of the Hebrew Bible (especially the Song of Songs), which penetrated both sacred and secular Hebrew poetry.\n\nNotable poets of the era \n\n Yehuda Halevi\n Solomon ibn Gabirol\n Samuel Hanagid\n Moses ibn Ezra\n Abraham ibn Ezra\n Dunash ben Labrat\n Joseph ben Tanchum\n\nReferences \n\nLiterature of Al-Andalus\nAndalusi-Jewish culture\nJewish medieval literature\nJewish poetry"},

It premiered on August 5, 2015. It was made available for digital download and released a single on August 6, 2015, by Interscope Records. The song, produced by Max Martin and  Ali Payami, features a guest appearance from American rapper Nicki Minaj.\n\nBackground and composition\nThicke and Minaj first collaborated on the track 'Shakin' It 4 Daddy' for Thicke's fourth studio album Sex Therapy: The Session (2009). Speaking on Minaj's involvement during an interview for On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Thicke said, 'I was working with Max Martin and [Savan Kotecha] and we had been messing with the song for a few months, and then Max finally got it to a place where he loved it and I thought it could use a little spice — a little edge. That’s when I sent it to Nicki and she loved it.' 'Back Together' is raging, disco-fied track.\n\nDuring an interview with Good Morning America, when asked about the meaning of the song or if there were any intended allusions to his ex-wife (Paula Patton) Thicke explained, 'Actually I didn't write the song so I can't take credit for the meaning, but when I met with the producers ... I just heard this idea of getting back together and getting yourself back together and, you know, what I was going through at the time I really related to that and connected with it so it's more about the theme of getting yourself back together with love and partnership'.\n\nRadio version and music video\n\nThe radio version of the song is censored, replacing the word 'fuck' with a sample of Thicke exclaiming 'Ow!' in a falsetto. This version is also used in the music video.\n\nThe music video features Thicke in a tuxedo at a poolside resort with an attractive woman to whom he addresses the song. She pushes him into the pool, seeming to indicate she's upset with him. Later they are together again, seemingly on another day, getting along. Thicke then walks through the hotel and sees Minaj in her room, where she performs her part of the track. Minaj seems to seduce him, only to walk away when he acquiesces to her advances. Having now lost both women, Thicke leaves the hotel but stops to join a band performing outside.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song was described by Los Angeles Times music writer Mikael Wood as 'a total banger, with a killer electro-disco groove ... and a delightfully raunchy guest verse by Nicki Minaj.' Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone wrote, ''Back Together' boasts a bumping Studio 54 disco beat and buzzsaw synths reminiscent of the electro-pop surge led by Justice and Daft Punk. Thicke, however, sounds as soulful as ever, breezily crooning devoted paeans to a destructive love over Martin's catchy production.'\n\nMusic video\nA music video for the song, directed by Ben Mor, was filmed in Miami. It was premiered via Thicke's VEVO channel on August 13, 2015.\n\nLive performances\nThicke has performed the song on Good Morning America, The Late Late Show with James Corden, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nOn May 21, 2017, Thicke performed this song at 4th Indonesian Choice Awards.\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications and sales\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2015 songs\n2015 singles\nDisco songs\nRobin Thicke songs\nNicki Minaj songs\nInterscope Records singles\nSong recordings produced by Max Martin\nSongs written by Max Martin\nSongs written by Ali Payami\nSongs written by Savan Kotecha\nSongs written by Nicki Minaj\nSongs written by Robin Thicke"},

{"id": "25502676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-controlled%20Vehicle%20System", "title": "Computer-controlled Vehicle System", "text": "The Computer-controlled Vehicle System, almost universally referred to as CVS, was a personal rapid transit (PRT) system developed by a Japanese industrial consortium during the 1970s. Like most PRT systems under design at the same time, CVS was based around a small four-person electric vehicle similar to a small minivan that could be requested on demand and drive directly to the user's destination. Unlike other PRT systems, however, CVS also offered cargo vehicles, included 'dual-use' designs that could be manually driven off the PRT network, and included the ability to stop at intersections in a conventional road-like network.\n\nWork on CVS started in the late 1960s as a demonstration system for a 'traffic game' at Expo '70. This demonstration was successful and led to a further development project in 1970, which expanded several times and eventually produced a large test track outside of Tokyo. However, in 1978, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport declined to grant CVS a license under existing safety regulations, citing issues with the short headway distances. As other proposed CVS deployments also dried up, work on the project ended some time that year.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\nThe concept of personal rapid transit (PRT) developed in the 1950s as a solution to the problem of providing mass transit in smaller urban areas and the suburbs of larger cities. Existing systems, heavy rail and subways, required major infrastructure and had high capital costs that limited their use to only the densest urban areas. Buses could run on existing roadways, but were thus subject to traffic problems and could not offer the high-speed services that made subways so attractive to riders.  Modern PRT really began around 1953 when Donn Fichter, a city transportation planner, began research on PRT and alternative transportation methods. In 1964, Fichter published a book, which proposed an automated public transit system for areas of medium to low population density.\n\nThe solution appeared to be a 'mini-subway', one that was small enough that the routes did not require the same sort of capital costs as a conventional system. However, using traditional technology to implement such a system would not work, as the required distance between vehicles on a subway system, known as headway, was often several minutes.  This would mean a low vehicle density, and, if this was combined with a small number of passengers per vehicle, a very low overall passenger capacity. If such a system was to be practical, the distance between the vehicles had to be reduced, something that the emerging computer market appeared able to address.\n\nDuring the 1950s the United States underwent a period of intense urban decay.  Planners pointed to the construction of the interstate highway system as the culprit; people were able to buy houses at low prices farther and farther from their jobs in the downtown cores, leading to a flight of capital out of the cities. Only those cities with well-developed mass transit systems, like New York and Boston, seemed to be avoiding these problems. If mass transit was the solution, there was a need for a system that could be built in smaller cities at reasonable prices. This led, naturally, to the PRT concept.\n\nPRT development was given a major boost in 1967 with the start of what would be delivered as the 'HUD reports', a series of industry studies funded by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which gave strong support to the PRT concept. The publication of the reports in 1968 as Tomorrow's Transportation sparked off a wave of developments around the world, as it appeared PRT was going to be 'the next big thing'. By the early 1960s there were dozens of PRT efforts underway, with a wide variety of solutions from what were essentially small subway systems to more complex systems that the HUD reports referred to as 'dial-a-cab'.\n\nTraffic Game\nAs part of the Expo '70 program in Osaka, starting in 1968 a university and industry team built a 'traffic game' in the Automobile Industries Pavilion. The network consisted of a grid of guideways on a 5 m grid carrying ten two-seat electrically powered cars. The cars communicated with a central computer using wires under the 'roadway', which allowed the computer to start and stop the vehicles at the intersections if there was crossing traffic. If there wasn't, the vehicles could travel through the intersection non-stop. This greatly increases passenger throughput by eliminating unneeded stops that occur on a fixed-schedule system (like traffic lights), increasing the average vehicle speed.\n\nIn spite of being a show floor demonstration system, the system was quite advanced compared to most PRT systems then under study. Most systems had been designed in the era of Generation II computers (the PDP-8 was common), which were large and relatively slow. These systems normally limited themselves to planning the route in a fixed network with no stops, which greatly simplified the routing task. Vehicles on the network were assumed to be running at a fixed speed or stopped completely in emergencies, there were no on-route stops that could complicate timing. This meant that the guideway network could not be built into existing infrastructure like roads where there are stops at crossing points along the route, stations had to be built 'off-line' to allow other vehicles to pass by at full speed.\n\nThe 'traffic game' demonstration system was much more flexible. The computer system knew the location of all of the vehicles at all times, and was able to speed up and slow down vehicles as needed at fixed points in the network. This meant the guideway system could be built in a fashion much more similar to conventional roadways, without the need to separate tracks at crossing points, or building offline stations. Although these types of infrastructure would improve performance of the system, in areas of less demand or traffic they could be eliminated to save on capital costs.\n\nWhen the 'traffic game' was system successful the designers suggested that a similar but more complex system be presented at the 18th Tokyo Motor Show late in 1971. A formal presentation was submitted to the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in July 1970, and accepted that autumn. Built between April and October 1971, the new system used 1:20th scale cars on a network representing the 300 m wide area of the Ginza district in Tokyo, with the centralized computer system able to control up to 1,000 vehicles.\n\nCVS\nFollowing the successful demonstration at the Tokyo Motor Show, MITI provided funding for development of a full-sized version of the same system at Higashimurayama, built on top of an existing car test track and former racetrack. Several other Japanese companies were already in the process of developing PRT systems, either self-designed or using licensed US designs, but the 'traffic game' design, with its crossing guideway network and ability to deal with traffic made it uniquely advanced.\n\nBasic track layout was completed by the middle of 1972 and construction of the short guideway section for the maintenance yard was completed by that autumn. Testing of frameless chassis started soon after. Construction of the rest of the track was completed by the autumn of 1973. The test track was 2 km long and about 200 m across, in the form of a large oval loop. In the center of the loop was a grid of crossing lines and several passenger stations at a 100 m spread, along with the maintenance and control facilities. The top portion of the loop was used for high-speed tests, while the bottom included two parallel tracks for lane-changing experiments. In total, the track containted 4.8 km of guideway.\n\nThe system originally envisioned a 100-vehicle mixed fleet, but rampant inflation in the 1970s led to budget cutbacks that were made good by reducing the fleet to 60. The basic passenger vehicle emerged as a four-person design that looked like a minivan with no 'hood' area for the engine. Since the emergency braking was extremely powerful, passengers were seated facing to the rear, and Japanese law already precluded standing in automated vehicles. In some versions, two of the four seats could be folded to allow larger loads, like prams or bicycles. CVS also tested light cargo vehicles, carrying between 300 and 400 kg. Three types of cargo bodies were tried; a flatbed version for palleted cargo that was loaded using two conveyor belts on a trackside 'station', another was similar to a pickup truck with a box end, and the last was an enclosed postal van.\n\nCVS also developed a dual-mode version of the vehicle, which they demonstrated at Expo '75 on Okinawa in July 1975. This version allowed potential customers to purchase a vehicle and drive it like a normal car for short distances at low speeds using battery power. For longer distances and higher speeds, the car would be driven onto the guideway, which would provide the higher power and automated guidance needed for higher speeds. Expo also hosted a larger group rapid transit system from Kobe Steel, which was a licensed version of the Alden staRRcar being built by Boeing Vertol.\n\nCancellation\nA two-phase testing program was carried out. Phase I was the basic construction and operation at various speeds with large headways, in order to work on the mechanical design. This phase completed in 1976, and was followed by Phase II, a 'system demonstration' at one-second headways (considerably less than a car). Phase II testing completed in 1978 and the consortium started looking for deployment opportunities, developing a serious proposal for an installation in Baltimore.\n\nHowever, CVS ran into the same difficulties as the many other PRT systems of the era. A combination of lowering gas prices, changes in attitudes toward major public projects of this size, and cost overruns in the demonstration system in Morgantown, and a lack of progress within the Urban Mass Transit Administration in the US all led to a souring of opinion for PRT systems.  For example, the California Public Utilities Commission states that its rail regulations apply to PRT, and these require railway-sized headways. The degree to which CPUC would hold PRT to 'light rail' and 'rail fixed guideway' safety standards is not clear because it can grant particular exemptions and revise regulations. Although by this point in time there were numerous fully developed systems ready to be installed, a lack of interest and funding meant no new PRT systems were installed, and only the much larger Canadian Bombardier ART and French VAL systems saw any deployment projects during the 1980s.\n\nJ. Edward Anderson, a long-time PRT advocate and critic, noted that the guideway was very large and had a major visual impact. However, many other systems used similar or larger guideways, including the Morgantown PRT, and the guideway was smaller than a conventional roadway. He also noted that the stations only had a single berth, which would limit capacity, and that the vehicles had a rough ride (they were unsprung).\n\nDescription\nCVS vehicles were built like contemporary vans, with a chassis holding the mechanical systems with a metal monocoque body placed on top. They were 3 m long, 1.6 wide and 1.85 high, and weighted about 1 ton. Motive power was provided by a conventional 200 VAC electric motor driving the rear wheels, which also provided regenerative braking at up to 0.2 G. Conventional brakes could increase this to 0.4 G. Emergency stopping at up to 2 G could be provided through an explosively fired device. The standard four-seat passenger vehicle weighed 2000 lbs.\n\nThe guideway consisted of parallel steel I-beams providing the running surface, with a third steel channel running down the middle of the two providing the guide rail, emergency stopping surface, vehicle power and communications. Due to the rubber-on-steel running surfaces, the maximum climbing grade was about 10 degrees, and would be reduced in wet or snowy weather. In good weather the vehicles normally ran at 40 km/h in the low-speed sections, but could run as high as 80 km/h in high-speed sections.\n\nVehicle control used a moving block control system, similar to those used on automated railways. Each vehicle had a small computer on board that communicated with the external scheduling systems every 1/2 second or less, sending in its current position with a resolution of less than 2 m. The position was measured by small spiral antennas running in the guide track, which also send position information to the scheduling computers at 1,200 bit/s over an inductive loop in the track.\n\nIn addition to the 'quantum' computers on the vehicles, three separate control systems were tested; Hitachi built a system for control at high speed on the outer loop based on a HIDIC-350 computer, allowing speeds up to 60 km/h, Toshiba provided a system based on the TOSBAC-40 that ran the lower-speed network area at speeds under 40 km/h, and Fujitsu added a third system based on the FACOM 230-35 that supervised the other two and switched traffic between them.\n\nVehicles normally operated at a one-second headway, meaning a single lane could carry as many as 3,600 vehicles per hour, for 14,400 seats per hour. In operation it was expected to operate at about 1/3 this capacity. This placed CVS right in the middle of the PRT/GRT spectrum, between busses which normally deliver about 3,000 passengers per direction per hour (PPDPH) and conventional subways which operate around 50,000 PPDPH.\n\nBibliography\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n - Total pages: 50 \n - Total pages: 309 \n - Total pages: 162 \n \n - pg. 77-83\n\nAutomated guideway transit\nMITI projects\nPersonal rapid transit"},

{"id": "68296140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delfini%20%28Split%20band%29", "title": "Delfini (Split band)", "text": "Delfini (trans. The Dolphins) were a Yugoslav band formed in Split in 1963. They were one of the pioneers of the Yugoslav rock scene.\n\nIn the 1960s the band performed beat music, gaining a reputation as one of the best Yugoslav beat bands. In the late 1960s they moved towards pop. They continued their career as a pop band throughout the 1970s, disbanding at the end of the decade.\n\nHistory\n\n1963–1979\nDelfini were formed in Split in 1963. The band went through several lineup changes before a firm lineup was formed: Željko Šoletić (vocals), Zdravko Botrić (guitar), Saša Lukić (keyboards), Ante Cetinić (bass guitar) and Damir Blažević (drums). Blažević was at one point replaced by Peco Petej (who would in the 1970s perform in the bands Time and Indexi). The band gained attention of the public with their appearance on a concert in Croatian National Theatre in Split organized by the Association of Musicians of Split.\n\nIn 1964 the band performed on a number of concerts entitled Prvi pljesak (The First Applause), organized by Mozaik (Mosaic) Society for Culture and Arts. They spent the summer of 1964 performing in Palas hotel on the island of Hvar. After their return to their hometown, they held their first solo concert, on which they performed with saxophonist Igor Lučer and trumpeter Tonči Puharič. The band started to hold concerts in the cellars of Diocletian's Palace in Split, with up to 1,500 members of the audience per performance. The band would perform in the Palace cellars throughout 1965 and 1966. Thanks to their live performances and the fact that all of the members had formal music education, Delfini gained the reputation as one of the best Yugoslav bands, which gave them the opportunity to perform during 1965 as a backing band for a number of popular Yugoslav singers: Arsen Dedić (who would describe them as 'the best beat band in Yugoslavia'), Ivica Šerfezi, Zdenka Vučković, Ana Štefok, Vice Vukov and others. In the mid-1960s the band was joined by new guitarist, Pavle Koralov.\n\nIn 1966 the band applied for the Melodije Jadrana 66 (Melodies of the Adriatic 66) music festival with the song 'More i ljeto' ('Sea and Summer'), composed by Lukić. Delfini wanted to perform the song themselves, but the festival organizers decided the song should be performed by a female vocalist, singer Maruška Šinković ending up performing it. Delfini were offered to appear on the festival performing the song 'Ča se noćas svitli luka' ('Why Is the Harbor So Bright This Evening'), which they refused. This event gained large attention of the media and the public support for the band by some popular singers. In 1967 the band signed a contract with Split tourist company Primorje (Seashore). The intention of the company was to create the city summer garden on a devastated field, and Delfini were hired to perform in the garden. After the garden was opened, it became the gathering place for the Split youth, with Delfini performing there every evening from 8:00 pm to 23:30 pm, with 1,000 to 1,500 people visiting each of their performances. In 1967 the band competed on the second edition of the Belgrade Gitarijada Festival, winning the second place, behind Crni Biseri. The band would also compete on the second edition of the Festival of Vocal-Instrumental Ensembles in Zagreb, held on 14 May 1967, where they also won the second place, behind Kameleoni. On the 1967 Split festival, they played the song 'Beat na moru' ('Beat on the Seashore'), a Serbo-Croatian cover of the song 'Running Out of the World', performed by the British band The Shadows on the same festival. 'Beat na moru' was released on the festival official EP Split '67, becoming a hit for the band.\n\nAt the beginning of 1968 the band moved to the country's capital, Belgrade, with an intention to gain nationwide popularity. They held 11 concerts in Belgrade Youth Center, and soon gained an opportunity to appear in the popular TV show Koncert za mladi ludi svet (Concert for Young Crazy World) and were offered a record contract by the PGP-RTB record label. In 1968 they released their debut record, the EP Naša serenada (Our Serenade). All four songs on the EP were authored by the band members, which was rare at the time, as 1960s Yugoslav rock bands would usually include covers of foreign rock hits on their records. The title track featured elements of folk music of Dalmatia, while the song 'Sedam koraka' ('Seven Steps') featured elements of Macedonian traditional music. The song 'Dioklecijan' ('Diocletian') was co-written by Toma Bebić (who would later gain fame as a singer-songwriter). This song is notable as the first song in the history of Yugoslav rock music to feature the technique of backmasking.\n\nAfter the EP release the band would start to move away from rock and towards pop scene. However, they also included a number of soul songs into their repertoire, and were joined by two new members, saxophone player Igor Lučer and trumpet player Tonči Puharič, both of which previously appeared on the band's concerts as guests. In the following years they moved back to Split and played as a backing band for a number of singers, played on fashion shows and often appeared on Radio Belgrade and Radio Zagreb. In the 1970s they got a new singer, Tonči Della Zotta. They released a number of pop-oriented 7' singles, often appeared on Yugoslav pop festivals and went on several Soviet Union tours. They ended their activity at the end of the decade, occasionally reuniting in the following decades under the name Dupini (a regional expression, also meaning The Dolphins).\n\nDiscography\n\nEPs\nNaša serenada (1968)\n\nCompilation albums\nHitovi (1984)\nHitovi II (1988)\n\nSingles\n'Kako je toplo ovo ljeto' / 'Mini-bikini' (1973)\n'Tonbula' / 'Dobro jutro, draga' (1976)\n'Od portuna do portuna' / 'Radio i mikrofon' (1977)\n'Od ponedjeljka novi život' / 'Intima' (1979)\n'Čobanica' / 'Srce samo jednom voli' (1979)\n'Prijateljstvo' / 'Natanijel' (1979)\n\nOther appearances\n'Beat na moru' (Split '67, 1967)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nDelfini at Discogs\n\nCroatian rock music groups\nYugoslav rock music groups\nBeat groups\nMusical groups established in 1962\nMusical groups disestablished in 1979"},

{"id": "38074271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeezus", "title": "Yeezus", "text": "Yeezus is the sixth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on June 18, 2013, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West gathered a number of artists and close collaborators for the production, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, Noah Goldstein, Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Travis Scott. The album also features guest vocals from Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson, and Frank Ocean.\n\nFifteen days before its release date, West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip down the sound of Yeezus in favor of a more minimalist approach. The album has been characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill. West's unconventional use of samples is also contained, as on 'Blood on the Leaves', which contains a sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of 'Strange Fruit'.\n\nNo album artwork is featured on the release of the former, and the physical CD edition was released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits. Initial promotion included worldwide video projections of the music and live television performances. West released two singles from the album; 'Black Skinhead' in July 2013 and 'Bound 2' the following month. The release of Yeezus coincided with that of rapper J. Cole's album Born Sinner, which was moved back a week to coincide with Yeezus release, leading to speculation about which release would sell more copies.\n\nYeezus received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it among West's best work and commended its brash direction, though public response was divided. The album was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 327,000 copies in the first week of release, while also topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Russia and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was named by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2010s, including Rolling Stone, who later included it at 269 on its 2020 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nBackground\n\nFollowing the release of his fifth studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), Kanye West collaborated with longtime friend Jay-Z on Watch the Throne (2011). In July 2012, producer No I.D. revealed that he had been working on West's sixth solo studio album (and seventh overall) and that it would be released after Cruel Summer (2012), a collaborative compilation album between members of West's record label GOOD Music. For Yeezus, West enlisted several collaborators, including Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson, S1, The Heatmakerz, Mike Dean, Hudson Mohawke, Skrillex, Young Chop, Chief Keef, Frank Ocean, Odd Future, Travis Scott, The-Dream, Cyhi the Prynce, Malik Yusef, King L, John Legend, James Blake, RZA, Mase, and Pusha T. The album features additional vocals by Justin Vernon, Frank Ocean, Kid Cudi, Chief Keef, King L, Assassin, and Charlie Wilson.\n\nWest was influenced primarily by minimalist design and architecture during the production of Yeezus, and visited a furniture exhibit in the Louvre five times. A single Le Corbusier lamp was his 'greatest inspiration'. West worked closely with the architect Oana Stănescu, and took 'field trips' to Le Corbusier homes. Fascinated by Stănescu's comments on the unusual and radical nature of Corbusier design choices, West applied the situation to his own life, feeling that 'visionaries can be misunderstood by their unenlightened peers'. West also met with architect Joseph Dirand and Belgian interior designer Axel Vervoordt, and had 'rare Le Corbusier lamps, Pierre Jeanneret chairs and obscure body-art journals from Switzerland' delivered to the loft. West also wanted a deep hometown influence on the album, and listened to 1980s house music most associated with his home city of Chicago for influence. Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain was also an inspiration for the album and its ensuing tour. The album was originally titled Thank God for Drugs.\n\nRecording and production\n\nIn 2012, West began recording his sixth studio album with collaborators, including No I.D. and DJ Khaled. The first recordings were held in January 2013, in the living room of his personal loft at a Paris hotel, referred to in the album's credits as the 'No Name Hotel'. West kept compositions simple in order to hear the tracks more clearly; too much bass or complexity would simply overpower the room's poor acoustics. The beats emanating from the loft space, which sometimes lasted through the night, provoked complaints from neighbors. Reports emerged that he and his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian had moved to the loft in order for West to begin work on the album.\n\nThe atmosphere in the studio was described by contributor Evian Christ as 'very focused', and West once again brought in several close collaborators. Producer Hudson Mohawke noted the inclusive 'group' atmosphere of the sessions, in which multiple contributors would work on similar pieces, with different elements ultimately selected from each. All involved were given a song to work on and return the next day to sit and critique, a process Anthony Kilhoffer compared to an art class. Producer Arca described being initially asked to send West music, noting that she purposefully sent perhaps the strangest stuff she had, with West happening to be excited by it. Describing West's collaborative style, Arca stated: It was a lot of coming up with design, like solving riddles. If the song called for something aggressive, it was up to three or four people to design what in their head was the best solution for that aggression in that moment. Everyone would approach it in completely different ways, and ultimately, it would all be edited by Kanye himself.\n\nDetermined to 'undermine the commercial', several tracks were left off the finished product that were deemed too melodic or more in line with West's previous material. West set parameters regarding sound and style, insisting that there be no 'bass wobbles' reminiscent of dubstep. The album's recording process was described as 'very raw' by Thomas Bangalter of the French electronic duo Daft Punk, who produced four songs for the album, adding that West was 'rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually'. While previous albums, particularly Dark Fantasy, took considerable time in the studio, Yeezus was described by Kilhoffer as 'the fastest record we ever made'. In May 2013, Def Jam executives listened to the 'final product', (only later to be changed) describing the album as 'dark'. American musician Travis Scott opined that the snippets he'd heard of Yeezus were from the year 3000 and recalled 'crazy memories' from being around West during the recording of it.\n\nW writer Christopher Bagley reports that West's creative process often bordered on perfectionist. In March 2013, West described the album to Bagley as near completion, only to revise this statement one month later to the album being 'only 30 percent complete'. West made several last-minute alterations to Yeezus, enlisting the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, Rick Rubin, as an executive producer for additional recording mere days before its release; changes included re-recording whole songs and rewriting entire verses. The rough cut West played Rubin ran nearly three and a half hours long. West's orders to Rubin were to take the music in a 'stripped-down minimal direction', often removing elements already recorded. In a September 2013 interview with radio DJ Zane Lowe, West said of Rubin that 'he's not a producer, he's a reducer'.\n\nFor several days in late May and early June 2013, West and a 'rotating group of intimates, collaborators and hangers-on' holed up at Rubin's Shangri-La studio in Malibu in service of completing the record. Rubin thought it impossible to meet the deadline and all involved ended up working long hours with no days off in order to complete the record. West had intended the album be 16 tracks until Rubin suggested cutting the album down to fewer tracks, from 16 songs to 10, saying the others could be reserved for a follow-up. Rubin gave as example 'Bound', which was 'a more middle of the road R&B song, done in an adult contemporary style' before West decided to replace the musical backing with a minimalistic sample, 'a single note bassline in the hook which we processed to have a punk edge in the Suicide tradition'. Two days before the album had to be delivered to the label, West wrote and sang the lyrics to two songs while also recording the vocals to three others in just two hours.\n\nMusic and composition\n\nAccording to Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot, Yeezus is a 'hostile, abrasive and intentionally off-putting' album that combines 'the worlds of' 1980s Chicago acid-house, 2013 Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the 'avant-rap' of Saul Williams, Death Grips, and Odd Future. The Independent, Mass Appeal, and The Village Voice described it as an experimental release, while Meagan Garvey of The Outline described it as West's 'industrial album'. Rolling Stone described it as 'an extravagantly abrasive album full of grinding electro, pummeling minimalist hip-hop, drone-y wooz and industrial gear-grind', while Vulture called it a 'punk rap opus', and Rolling Stone called it an 'industrial-rap opus'. Slant Magazine critic Ted Scheinman described the album as 'built on alien, angular beats, slowly morphing drones and sirens, abrupt periods of silence, and a pulse-quickening style of delivery from Yeezy himself', writing that West reconceives the 'notion of what kind of music (or noise) can underpin hip-hop'. According to Charles Aaron of Spin, Yeezus is 'a hip hop album, not a rap album', because of how its sounds and subject matter are assembled together, and although listeners can hear ''punk' or 'post-punk' or industrial'' throughout, 'hip-hop has always been about noise and dissonance and dance music as agitation'. The album also incorporates elements of industrial and trap music. The record 'most closely resembles' 1990s industrial rock, during which the genre had a significant pop culture impact, with artists such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and Marilyn Manson gaining success. The industrial scene created a 'vast global underground community', and Esquire notes that one of its epicenters was in Chicago, where West was raised. Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club characterized its opening series of songs as electro and industrial hip hop.\n\nReferencing the sound of Yeezus in September 2013, West stated: 'For me as Kanye West, I got to fuck shit up... I'm going to take music and try to make it three dimensional... I'm not here to make easy listening, easily programmable music'. At the same time, he viewed himself as artistically being 'here to crack the pavement and break new ground, sonically'. West would later go onto describe the sound of the album as 'a protest to music'. West elaborated, claiming that he 'was like 'I'm gonna take my ball and go home''.\n\nYeezus is primarily electronic in nature, and boasts distorted drum machines and synthesizers that sound like they're malfunctioning, low-resolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to the most analog sounds. To this end, the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of CD skips or corrupted MP3's, and Auto-Tuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher. Esquire cites 'On Sight' as an early example of the album's connection to electronic music, citing its 'droning synthesizer tone', which is 'modulated until the signal starts throwing off harshly treble-heavy spikes and begins to clip, as if it were overloading a digital audio processor'.\n\nYeezus continues West's practice of eclectic samples: he employs an obscure Hindi sample on 'I Am a God', and a sample of 1970s Hungarian rock group Omega on 'New Slaves'. 'On Sight' interpolates a melody from 'Sermon (He'll Give Us What We Really Need)' by the Holy Name of Mary Choral Family, although the track originally sampled an old vocal track from the original recording. As late as a week prior to release, lawyers were forced to track down the choir director and members of the choir on the South Side of Chicago in order to get clearance for such a sample. Def Jam executives were significantly worried enough the deal would not be in place in time for the record's deadline, and producers re-recorded the vocals with a new choir as the sample could not be cleared in enough time. 'Bound 2' features heavy soul music samples and has been described as the only song on Yeezus which recalls the sound of West's early work. 'Bound', a 1971 song by American soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One from their album 2 + 2 + 1 = Ponderosa Twins Plus One, serves as the primary sample used in West's track.\n\nThe album's second track 'Black Skinhead' has alternately been called an industrial hip hop song and 'a galloping punk-rap manifesto'. 'I Am a God' was inspired by a 'diss' from a major fashion designer, who informed West of his invitation to a widely anticipated runway show on the condition he agree to not attend other shows. 'I'm in It' began with a different sample and melody, but West removed the sample and Rubin edited the track down from a six-minute arrangement. 'Blood on the Leaves', which samples Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of 'Strange Fruit' and was the first track in the first incarnation of the track list, is an example of West's signature dichotomy in which he melds the sacred and profane. 'Strange Fruit', first recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939, brought the lynchings of black Americans to a 'startling poignancy', creating 'one of the most towering, important songs of the 20th century'. West's anthemic re-telling instead details an MDMA-fueled hookup and the perils of fame.\n\nPromotion and release\n\nOn May 1, 2013, West used Twitter to post a single message reading 'June Eighteen', leading several media outlets to speculate that the post referred to the release date of West's upcoming album. On May 17, he began promotion of the album by unveiling the previously unreleased song 'New Slaves' through video projections in 66 assorted locations. The following day, West appeared on the American late-night live television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live and performed the songs 'New Slaves' and 'Black Skinhead'. West subsequently revealed the album's cover and title, Yeezus, on his official website. Fellow rapper Kendrick Lamar offered his opinion on the title in an interview that same month, stating: 'That's crazy, I want to hear that. That's that creative Kanye genius stuff out the box'. He also claimed that the album's 'whole marketing scheme is crazy' and 'very inspiring'. The iTunes Store made Yeezus available for pre-order on May 20, but the listing was subsequently taken down for unknown reasons. On May 29, A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou unveiled an advertisement for Yeezus which stated that the album would not be available for pre-order. Speaking about the album's minimal promotion, West stated: 'With this album, we ain't drop no single to radio. We ain't got no NBA campaign, nothing like that. Shit, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music'.\n\nIn May 2013, American rapper J. Cole called West 'one of the greatest artists of our generation' via Twitter, with him following this by tweeting: 'Which is exactly why I'm moving my release date up. Born Sinner June 18th'. He explained releasing his second studio album Born Sinner on the same day as Yeezus during an interview that same month, saying: 'I'm not going to sit [here]... I worked too hard to come a week later after Kanye West drops an amazing album. It'd be like, 'Oh and J.Cole dropped too, a week later.' Nah. I'm going to go see him on that date. He's the greatest'. The next month, J. Cole gave further context, claiming for the coinciding release to be 'more about the statement' than the sales. J. Cole elaborated on this, admitting that the music being competed over 'is art' and he 'can't compete against the Kanye West celebrity and the status that he's earned just from being a genius', though stated: 'But I can put my name in the hat and tell you that I think my album is great and you be the judge and you decide'. A lyrical reference to releasing on the same date as West is included in the track 'Forbidden Fruit' from Born Sinner.\n\nThe physical CD edition of Yeezus was released in a clear jewel box with no album artwork, reflecting the minimalist tone. The packaging consists of little more than a piece of red tape and a sticker affixed to the back, with sample credits and the album's UPC. Other versions of this release have different colors of stickers, with green, yellow and orange being some of the other colors. The front is affixed with a Parental Advisory label. The Source pointed out a resemblance between the Yeezus CD packaging and a packaging concept designed for the single 'Crystal' by the English band New Order in 2001. In a 2016 BBC interview with Annie Mac, West explained the album cover; 'The whole concept for the Yeezus album is that we're not going to be using CDs in the future and since this is the last time we're going to see it, this is an open casket for the CD.'\n\nDef Jam confirmed in late June 2013 that 'Black Skinhead' would be serviced to American radio as the album's first single on July 2, 2013, and that a music video for the track was being produced. It was officially released to radio in the United Kingdom on June 19. The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and 34 on the UK Singles Chart. In August 2013, it was revealed that 'Bound 2' would be released as the second single from Yeezus. 'Bound 2' features vocals from American soul singer Charlie Wilson and incorporates numerous samples into its production, including prominent elements of the song 'Bound' (1971) by soul group Ponderosa Twins Plus One. 'Bound 2' received general acclaim from music critics, who referred to the song as one of the highlights of the album and compared its soul sample-based production to West's early work from his debut studio album The College Dropout (2004). The song has since peaked at number 55 on the UK Singles Chart. In November 2013, producer Hudson Mohawke revealed that 'Blood on the Leaves' would serve as the album's third single. West subsequently made the announcement in an interview on New York's 92.3 NOW.\n\nOn September 6, 2013, West announced The Yeezus Tour, a North American tour to take place between October 19 through December 7, 2013; two months prior to West's announcement, Yeezus co-producer Mike Dean had announced a tour for the album. The tour was marketed as his 'first solo tour in 5 years', and featured Kendrick Lamar, Pusha T, A Tribe Called Quest, and Travis Scott as the supporting acts. On October 30, 2013, while on the road to Vancouver, a truck carrying custom-made video screens and equipment for the show was involved in a car accident, the crash damaged the equipment beyond repair. The tour resumed on November 16, 2013, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The missed Chicago and Detroit shows were rescheduled however, the rest of the missed dates were cancelled, Def Jam cited routing logistics as the reason.\n\nCritical reception\n\nYeezus was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 46 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.2 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nReviewing the album in The Guardian, lead critic Alexis Petridis found it 'noisy, gripping, maddening, potent', while Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph said it was 'the most exciting album' she had heard in some time. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone called it a 'brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct' that made other abrasive records by 'mad geniuses', such as In Utero by Nirvana and Radiohead's Kid A, seem tame by comparison. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal viewed it as a 'razor-sharpened take' on West's fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak, concluding that 'cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus, perhaps more than any other Kanye album. Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the album's fast 40 minutes'. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt it was his most ambitious piece of music yet, and Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club said it was his most uninhibited record: 'Even by the standards of an artist who reinvents himself with each release, it's a drastic departure'. In a highly positive review, AllMusic's David Jeffries opined that the album was an 'extravagant stunt with the high-art packed in, offering an eccentric, audacious, and gripping experience that's vital and truly unlike anything else'. Ann Powers of NPR described the album as 'juxtaposing avant-garde industrial and electronic innovations with the high romantic hip-hop West had already perfected.' Rock artist Lou Reed reviewed Yeezus in July 2013 shortly before his death, describing it as majestic and inspiring. 'He's really trying to raise the bar. No one's near doing what he's doing, it's not even on the same planet'.\n\nSome reviewers expressed reservations. In The New York Times, Jon Pareles said West's innovative transfiguration of his music—with unrefined electronica and drill elements—was undermined by his distasteful lyrics and appropriation of 1960s civil rights slogans 'to his own celebrity or to bedroom exploits'. In Robert Christgau's opinion, the combination of harsh rock and hip hop sounds on Yeezus was as bold as Public Enemy's music during the 1980s, but West's lyrics were grotesquely off-putting. 'He's wordsmith enough to insure that his sexist imagery is very hard to take', Christgau wrote in The Barnes & Noble Review, looking at the album as an 'alt-rap also-ran'. Chris Richards from The Washington Post found West's lyricism perhaps 'his least compelling' yet and 'drunk on bitterness', though viewed the album as 'West at his most wasted, stumbling through rubble'. Alex Griffin of Tiny Mix Tapes expressed similar feelings, describing it as 'a nebulous, dense, paranoid web of utterly unfiltered expression that's utterly or negligibly fascinating depending on how much you care about Yeezy'. In The Times, Will Hodgkinson surmised that Yeezus could have been West's masterpiece had he not become 'so hopelessly self-important'.\n\nAccolades \n\nBased on 146 individual year-end top ten lists compiled by Metacritic, Yeezus was the most critically acclaimed album of 2013, appearing on 61 lists and being named first on 18 of them. In October 2013, Complex named Yeezus the sixth best hip hop album of the last five years. Yeezus was rated as album of the year by nine publications. Spin named it the best album of 2013, writing, 'Yeezus was a thorny tangram puzzle of boxy headbanger blats that exemplified a year of equally stripped-down, basal pleasures'. The A.V. Club named it the best album of 2013 saying 'It's magnificent, and it sounds like absolutely nothing else'. Rolling Stone named it the second best album of 2013, comparing it in concept to Reed's polarizing 1975 album Metal Machine Music: 'No wonder the late, great Lou Reed embraced Yeezus, since it's basically the Metal Machine Music concept translated into futuristic hip-hop, all industrial overload and hypertense egomania and hostile vibes'. Exclaim! also named it the hip hop album of the year. NME named it the second best album of the year calling it 'his most sonically challenging album to date'. Stereogum, Time, and Complex were also among the publications that named Yeezus the best album of 2013.\n\nYeezus  was also nominated in two categories at the 2014 Grammy Awards including for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for 'New Slaves'. West responded unfavorably to this due to not receiving more nominations. He then addressed the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at one of his concerts and referred to it as patronizing. The album received nominations for; Foreign Rap Album of the Year at the Hungarian Music Awards, International Album of the Year at the Danish Music Awards, World's Best Album at the 2014 World Music Awards, and Best Album at the 2014 NME Awards.\n\nIn January 2014, Yeezus was named the best album of 2013 by The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll. By topping the poll, West attained his fourth album to do so, following on from The College Dropout, Late Registration, and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2004, 2005, and 2010, respectively. On the same poll for singles, 'Bound 2', 'New Slaves', and 'Black Skinhead' were ranked in the top 10. In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked Yeezus as the 269th album on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.\n\nCommercial performance\nYeezus debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming West's sixth chart-topping album and selling 327,000 copies in the United States in its first week. The album failed to reach the 500,000 sales projections, and marked West's lowest solo opening week sales in the US. However, it still had the third-best first week sales of 2013 at the time of release and marked the highest first week sales by a hip hop album since Drake's 2011 album Take Care. Simultaneously, Born Sinner entered at number two on the Billboard 200 with sales of 297,000 copies, selling 30,000 less than Yeezus. The second week sales saw the album fall dramatically; although it descended two places to end at number three on the chart, sales dropped by 80% to 65,000 units, making Yeezus the largest second-week percentage drop for a number one-debuting album in 2012–13 and the fourth-largest for a number one-bowing album in the SoundScan era. Billboards Keith Caulfield attributed the diminished figures to the non-traditional marketing, considering that the lack of singles and public appearances led the album to find 'difficulty in sustaining its momentum'. That same week, Born Sinner remained at number two on the Billboard 200, outselling Yeezus by nearly 20,000 units with sales of 84,000 copies. The following week, Born Sinner climbed to number one on the chart, tying the peak position attained by Yeezus previously. On August 12, 2013, Yeezus was certified gold in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 500,000 copies. By September 19, 2013, the album had sold 537,000 copies, being outperformed by the 599,000 copies sold of Born Sinner. J. Cole responded to this by commenting that he doesn't 'live for the accolades' and claiming: 'I'm more so about the music. Making it, and putting it out. Those are the two best feelings'. Yeezus was later certified platinum in the US by the RIAA on January 8, 2014, for shipments of one million albums shipped to stores and digital retailers. As of February 2016, the album has sold 750,000 copies in the United States. Yeezus was ranked as the 37th most popular album of 2013 on the Billboard 200.\n\nOn the ARIA Albums Chart, Yeezus initially debuted at number two after selling 9,500 copies in three days, entering behind The Great Country Songbook by Troy Cassar-Daley and Adam Harvey at the summit. However, after a data error was found, a re-count of sales was done. The re-count found that Yeezus was actually the number one album of the week. ARIA issued an apology and the chart was fixed. The album stood as West's first chart topper in Australia. Yeezus reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming West's fifth chart-topping album in Canada. In the United Kingdom, the album experienced a chart-topping performance, with it debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart and giving West his first number one on the chart since Graduation in 2007, as well as his fourth top ten album in the UK. The following week, Yeezus descended five places to number six on the UK Albums Chart. The album was ultimately certified gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on February 20, 2015, for sales of 100,000 units. Yeezus was also a chart topper in Denmark, New Zealand and Russia. The album was the ninth best-selling cassette album in the US in 2017.\n\nPublic reaction\n\nPublic reaction to Yeezus, including its unorthodox and deliberate lack of promotion as well as its brash and aggressive sound, was mixed. Yeezus was noted as one of the most anticipated releases of 2013 by major publications, but the lack of a major radio single was regarded as a risky move. Regardless, radio stations have still played tracks from Yeezus on air, despite it being a departure from the normal playlists found on hip-hop stations. 'When I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more', stated West at his headlining June 9, 2013 Governor's Ball performance, where he unveiled several tracks from the record for the first time. Rolling Stone summarized the audience's response: 'Half the crowd cheered, half almost audibly rolled their eyes'. West's June 11 interview with Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was similarly viewed with a mixed reaction, with many outlets mocking West's seemingly vain statements. In the article, West compares himself to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and refers to himself as 'the nucleus of all society'.\n\nWithin four days prior to the release, Yeezus was leaked online. The New York Times wrote that the leak 'stirred up a Twitter frenzy' and received widespread media coverage. The Washington Post commented on the significance of the leak: 'Kanye West’s new album didn’t leak online over the weekend. It gushed out into the pop ecosystem like a million barrels of renegade crude — ominous, mesmerizing and of great consequence'. Critics were very kind to Yeezus regarding critical reviews, but others viewed the release as 'musical and commercial suicide', and 'fans live-blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook'. The New Yorkers Sasha Frere-Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the 'lean vibrancy' of the album. 'One of the most fascinating aspects of Yeezus arrival is the discursive crisis it's caused, produced by a fast-react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding', wrote The Atlantic columnist Jack Hamilton.\n\nWest was criticized by the UK and US Parkinson's disease Associations for controversial lyrics in lead-song 'On Sight'. Oasis lead member Liam Gallagher criticized Yeezus over its title, saying of West: 'He's a fucking idiot. You'll never see Jesus banging his head'. American rapper Hopsin dissed West over the album within the lyrics of his single 'Hop Is Back' in October 2013, while the music video included Hopsin reenacting one of West's numerous encounters with the paparazzi. That same month, Hopsin went on to explain the diss, admitting that he is a fan of West who likes a lot of his older music and viewing Yeezus as West 'on some straight up [bullshit]'. \n\nJay-Z described Yeezus as 'polarizing', though claimed 'that's what great art is' and that West 'pushes the genre forward' with his experimentation. Expressing his thoughts on the mixed reception of the album in October 2013, fellow rapper Lupe Fiasco viewed himself as not facing the same difficult struggle. Lupe Fiasco continued, assuring that his then-upcoming studio album Tetsuo & Youth (2015) wouldn't be as open for interpretation as Yeezus. In February 2014, English singer Lily Allen announced that she would title her third studio album Sheezus. In an interview with Australian radio station Nova, Allen stated that she is terrified that West would think it's 'a diss rather than a tribute'. She said that she thinks West is brilliant and praised him for speaking his mind all the time. That same month, Jack White, a vocal advocate of analog recording, remarked that Yeezus 'is obviously recorded on Pro Tools but sounds unbelievable, because it is very simple and there aren't a lot of components going on, and this really allows the songs to shine. Plus he mixed using analogue components'. West went on to make the claim in October 2015 that despite many people rating My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy as his best album, Yeezus is 'so much stronger' in comparison.\n\nIn 2013, Yeezus was voted as both the year's 'Most Overrated Album' and 'Most Underrated Album' by Pitchfork readers.\n\n Track listing Notes signifies a co-producer\n signifies an additional producer\n 'I Am a God' credits God as a featured artist and features additional vocals by Justin Vernon\n 'New Slaves' features additional vocals by Frank Ocean\n 'Hold My Liquor' features vocals by Chief Keef and Justin Vernon\n 'I'm in It' features vocals by Justin Vernon and Assassin\n 'Guilt Trip' features uncredited vocals by Kid Cudi\n 'Send it Up' features vocals by King L\n 'Bound 2' features additional vocals by Charlie WilsonSample credits 'On Sight' contains an interpolation of 'Sermon (He'll Give Us What We Really Need)', written by Keith Carter, Sr.\n 'I Am a God' contains samples of 'Forward Inna Dem Clothes', written by Clifton Bailey III and H.

Federal land adjacent to the airfield included a WWII B-25 Mitchell plant and modification center and a Military Air Transport terminal. After being used as a Cold War-era Air Force Base, it was used for airliner servicing by TWA and for automobile and jet fighter aircraft production by General Motors, which built a 1985 Fairfax Plant over runways when the municipal airport closed.\n\nBackground \nThe airport site is on the Goose Island (Kansas) river bend.  At Goose Island, the United States Government constructed flood protection levees and walls around the Fairfax Industrial District, as well as three pump houses including two on the airfield that was first used for a 1921 'American Legion air meet'. The airfield was subsequently used by Emory J. Sweeney's  School of Aviation.\n\nSweeney Airport \nSweeney Airport was named in 1925, and the 403 Pursuit Squadron was assigned to Kansas City at the end of 1925.  The 'Fairfax plat' map with the airport was drawn on April 1, 1925, as an area 'of 1,373.07 acres' outside the city limits divided as follows: 'The Kansas City Industrial Land Company owned 1,122.85 acres; the Union Pacific Railroad Company owned 32.80 acres; eight private owners owned 72.18 acres; two railroads other than the Union Pacific owned 66.47 acres; land set aside for dedicated roads was 31.54 acres; [and] land on which dikes were built was 57.23 acres.'  Sweeney Airport was mapped by the United States Department of Commerce on July 17, 1928, as a trapezoid with .\n\nFairfax Airport \nFairfax Airport was named in 1928 when Sweeney Airport 'was taken over by Wood Brothers Corporation'--Charles Lindbergh and Phil Love landed at the airport 'in Love's Ryan monoplane' on August 2, 1928.  Dedicated in 1929, the facility was operated by the 'Fairfax Airport Company' ('Fairfax Airports, Inc.' in 1931), and the 1st Fairfax passenger service aircraft was a Fokker Super Universal cabin plane (5 passengers) of the Universal Aviation Corporation.  The Southwest Air Service Express airline scheduled flights from 'Fairfax Airport' to Dallas/Ft Worth in March 1929, and a 'Travelair six-passenger carrier of Central Air Lines crashed on approach to Fairfax in January 1930.  An 'impressive structure' costing $60,000 and with pay toilets for extra profit was built in 193x as a new administration building, and the land also had a natural gas field with 14 wells for extra revenue (a post-WWII Phillips Petroleum tract was along tanks of the Great Lakes Pipe Line Company.)  In 1933, the airport had hangars; airlines including American, Braniff, and US Airways; and aircraft manufacturers such as Rearwin Airplanes (American Eagle Eaglet aircraft were also being produced.)  By 1938, the Eddie Fisher Flying Service used Waco RNF aircraft for flight instruction.\n\nMilitary support \n\nAdjacent to Fairfax Airport was a 1935–42 naval reserve air base, which by 1940 was a Navy Elimination Air Base ('E-base', colloq.) for screening aviation candidates.  Survey work for an Air Force Plant began in December 1940, and the city purchased the airport in February 1941 for $600,000 from the Kansas City Industrial Land Company.  The United States Army Air Forces (AAF) leased the city's Fairfax Airport by 1941; when the Works Projects Administration allotted $1,536,717 for improvements and expansion of the  airport.  The 4 civilian runways were improved with concrete of 150 feet in width and 185,000 square yards of parking apron.—the government also purchased an alfalfa field of  for the AAF plant and for right-of-way to the airfield.  Groundbreaking for Air Force Plant NC, a 'government-owned, contractor-operated' plant of North American Aviation was on March 8, 1941.  (a USAAF Modification Center was built May–October 1942—a different modification center was at Kansas City, Missouri.)  Fairfax's civilian manufacturing facility for Rearwin airplanes was bought in early 1942 by 'Australian-owned' Commonwealth Aircraft Company which also opened a 2nd airplane factory in Kansas City, Missouri, at West Bottoms.  Military Air Transport Service moved an air freight terminal to Fairfax on 2 March 1945 from Kansas City, Missouri, and the Fairfax military installation became an operating location of Rosecrans Army Airfield on April 15, 1945 (the Air Transport Command operating location at Fairfax was discontinued by December 6, 1945.)\n\nPost-war operations \nBy late 1945 Transcontinental and Western Air used the former modification center for aircraft maintenance until the Great Flood of 1951—the city of Kansas City, Mo., built the new Mid-Continent Airport for the TWA Kansas City Overhaul Base northwest of the city (the modification center was razed shortly after March 1985).  Commonwealth Aircraft produced post-war Skyranger aircraft at Fairfax until 'transferred in 1946 to the former Columbia Aircraft factory' in New York, and the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Plant adjacent to Fairfax Field, operating in the leased former bomber plant, 'finished its first automobile in June 1946'.  Post-war military activations at Fairfax included the 4101st Army Air Force Base Unit (Reserve Training) on July 12, 1946 and the 564th Bombardment Squadron on January 6, 1947.\n\nDespite a 1948 plan for the base to 'be withdrawn from surplus', in 'October 1949 the U.S. Air Force terminated its lease on Fairfax Airport, and the city of Kansas City, Kansas, regained control of the facility'.  An 'annexation ordinance' expanded the city limits to encompass the 'United States Government [area of] 2 acres' and the airport's  with 13 buildings—the 'Fairfax plat' was the area within the northeast corner of the Fairfax Industrial District of ~.  On May 22, 1950, Fairfax's 2472d AF Reserve Training Center and 442d Troop Carrier Wing moved to Naval Air Technical Training Center Olathe.  In 1950 Mid-Continent Airlines was contracted for airmail out of Fairfax (North Central Route#106 operations moved to the Mid-Continent Airport after the 1951 flood.)  The 4610th Air Base Squadron at Fairfax Field became the April 1951 base operating unit for the nearby Air Force Base under construction at Grandview Airport (Fairfax's Air Defense Command units moved to Grandview Air Force Base after beneficial occupancy on February 16, 1954.)\n\nMunicipal airport \nFairfax Municipal Airport was named by the time of the Great Flood of 1951 and in 1953 the F-84F Thunderflash aircraft assembly line was in the same  GM Assembly Plant.  On June 20, 1954 a Zantop DC-3A crashed on approach to Fairfax, killing 3.  Fairfax was the July 12, 1955 landing site of a TWA DC-3 trainer that 'had just taken off from Fairfax' before colliding with and destroying a Cessna of Baker's Flying Service.  The 1963 fatal journey for Patsy Cline's Piper Comanche began at Fairfax, and the airport was added to the GNIS on October 13, 1978.  Fairfax's longest runway (17/35) was  long when the airport's last flight departed on March 31, 1985, and on April 1, 1985, the land was added to the Fairfax District industrial area. The General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant was completed in 1985 on the runways, and auto production at the WWII bomber plant building ceased in May 1987 (GM had purchased it in 1960 and it was razed in 1989).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1921 establishments in Kansas\nAirports established in 1921\n1985 disestablishments in Kansas\nKansas\nDefunct airports in Kansas\nHistory of Kansas City, Kansas"},

The 1954 team won the Pacific Coast League (PCL) pennant with a 107–61 record. Bob Scheffing was the team's manager. The team played its home games at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. \n\nIn 1993, sports writer John Schulian wrote a feature story in Sports Illustrated about the 1956 Angeles, opining that no minor league club ever played the game better. Gene Mauch, who played second base for the team and later managed in the majors, was interviewed by Schulian and recalled: 'I might be prejudiced, but I think it was the best minor league team ever put together. I saw some teams in the big leagues that couldn't play as well. Hell, I managed two of them.' \n\nFirst baseman Steve Bilko received the Pacific Coast League Most Valuable Player Award and was also named Minor League Baseball's player of the year. He also won the PCL Triple Crown with a .360 batting average, 55 home runs, and 164 RBIs. \n\nIn addition to Bilko, five other Angels hit 20 or more home runs. Gene Mauch hit .348 with 20 home runs.

He was a master at devising trick plays, stealing opponents' signs and, if necessary, getting in the face of a teammate.'\n\nWhile Dave Hillman won 20 games for the Angels, pitching was the team's weakness. In his history of the Angels, Richard Beverage wrote: 'The pitching staff was subpar and, as a result, th4 1956 Angels were probably a level below the greatest teams of PCL history.'\n\nAngels players took eight of 14 spots the PCL All-Star team selected by sports writers in November 1956. The honorees were Steve Bilko at first base, Mauch at second base, Casey Wise at shortstop, Jim Bolger and Bob Speake in the outfield, El Tappe at catcher, Dave Hillman as a pitcher, and Piper Davis as the utility infielder.\n\nStatistics\n\nBatting \nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n\nPitching \nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; PCT = Win percentage; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n 'The Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League: A History, 1903-1957', Richard Beverage (McFarland 2011)\n 'The Greatest Minor League: A History of the Pacific Coast League, 1903-1957', by Dennis Snelling (McFarland 2011)\n\n1956 in sports in California\nPacific Coast League seasons"},
{"id": "5327253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%20258/03", "title": "T 258/03", "text": "T 258/03, also known as Auction Method/Hitachi, is a decision of a Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (EPO), issued on April 21, 2004. It is a landmark decision for interpreting Article 52(1) and (2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC) which built on the principles suggested by the same Board in T 641/00 (Comvik, Two identities). This decision, amongst others, but notably this one and T 641/00, significantly affected the assessment of an invention’s technical character and inventive step.\n\nIt mainly stated that 'a method involving technical means [was] an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC' and in stating so contrasts with T 931/95 (Pension Benefit Systems Partnership), which held that 'the mere fact that data processing and computing means, i.e. technical means, [were] recited in a method claim [did] not necessarily confer a technical character to the claimed method'. T 258/03 put apparatus and method claims on an equal footing for the patentability examination of Article 52(2) EPC.\n\nIn other words, the Board of Appeal in this decision 'pointed the way to the new test and argued that the term ‘invention’ in the definition of patentable inventions set out in Article 52(1) of the EPC was merely to be construed as ‘subject matter having technical character’. Thus, the presence of computer hardware in a claim to a business method, providing a technical character, would now be sufficient to overcome the business method objection, regardless of technical contribution.'\n\nReasoning on patentable subject-matter \n\nThe invention in the application under examination related to an 'automatic Dutch auction method executed in a server computer'.\n\nThe Board of Appeal first made it clear that:\n there are four requirements to be fulfilled for some claimed subject-matter to be patented: '(1) it should be an 'invention', and this invention must be (2) new, (3) inventive, and (4) industrially applicable', that \n the term 'invention' is to be construed as 'subject-matter having technical character', and finally that \n the 'verification that claimed subject-matter is an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC' must be done before performing the three other tests, i.e. the novelty, the inventive step and the industrial applicability tests.\nConsequently, and having regard to the structure of the EPC, the Board held that 'it should be possible to determine whether subject-matter is excluded under Article 52(2) EPC without any knowledge of the state of the art (including common general knowledge)'.\n\nThis approach confirmed that the Boards of Appeal of the EPO have abandoned the 'contribution approach', which consisted in deciding whether a claimed subject-matter is an invention by deciding whether it brought forward a contribution to the art in a field non excluded from patentability, and therefore by inherently taking into account prior art during this first step. \n\nThe Board then confirmed the fact that a mixture of technical and non-technical feature may be patentable, and inferred that 'a compelling reason for not refusing under Article 52(2) EPC subject-matter consisting of technical and non-technical features is simply that the technical features may in themselves turn out to fulfil all requirements of Article 52(1) EPC.' \n\nTherefore, an apparatus claim comprising clearly technical features such as a 'server computer', 'client computers' and a 'network' is an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC (as held in T 931/95). But, the Board also held that the approach also applies to method claims, thus departing from T 931/95. The Board justified this with the following analysis: \n'an assessment of the technical character of a method based on the degree of banality of the technical features of the claim would involve remnants of the contribution approach by implying an evaluation in the light of the available prior art or common general knowledge.'\n\nWhat may be viewed as general guidelines for the examination of patentable subject-matter under the EPC were then stated or confirmed:  \n'What matters having regard to the concept of 'invention' within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC is the presence of technical character which may be implied by the physical features of an entity or the nature of an activity, or may be conferred to a nontechnical activity by the use of technical means. Hence, (...), activities falling within the notion of a non-invention 'as such' would typically represent purely abstract concepts devoid of any technical implications.'\n\nConsequences \n\nThis 'comparatively broad interpretation of the term 'invention' in Article 52(1) EPC will include activities which are so familiar that their technical character tends to be overlooked, such as the act of writing using pen and paper.' However, as the Board put it, 'this does not imply that all methods involving the use of technical means are patentable. They still have to be new, represent a non-obvious technical solution to a technical problem, and be susceptible of industrial application.'\n\nReasoning on inventive step \n\nAlthough the claims were held to be inventions within the meaning of Article 52(1), (2) and (3) EPC, they were found to lack inventive step. The application was refused.\n\nMore precisely, the invention was viewed as a mixture of technical and non-technical features, and was assessed with respect to the requirement of inventive step by taking account only the features which contributing to a technical character (in accordance with the principles of T 641/00). No step of the claimed method was found to be designed 'in such a way as to be particularly suitable for being performed on a computer' so that it may have contribute in a technical manner to inventive step. A particular method step which may have been a candidate involving technical contribution was found by the Board to result from 'a routine programming measure well within the reach of the skilled person'.\n\nSee also \n G 3/08, opinion of the Enlarged Board of Appeal\n List of decisions of the EPO Boards of Appeal relating to Article 52(2) and (3) EPC\n Software patents under the European Patent Convention\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Decision T 258/03 on the 'EPO boards of appeal decisions' section of the EPO web site\n\nSoftware patent case law\nEuropean Patent Office case law\n2004 in case law\n2004 in Europe\nAuction case law"},

{"id": "1750704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club%20in%202005", "title": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 2005", "text": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 2005 played their County Championship games in Division Two and their Totesport League games in Division One. Under their new captain, Vikram Solanki, they were tipped to go straight back up to the top flight of the County Championship and started the season 9–2 second favourites to end up as Division Two champions.\n\nThey started the season with a convincing win against Derbyshire in the Championship, followed by a comfortable win over Northamptonshire in a rain-affected Sunday League game. Their second game of the Championship, against Durham at Chester-le-Street, however, was a humiliating 7 wicket defeat inside two days. They then lost a close game against Lancashire over four days, and another close game against Middlesex on the following Sunday.\n\nOn 5 May they eased past Scotland to reach the Second Round of the C&G Trophy. In the second week of May, they were humbled by Loughborough UCCE, who comfortably beat them. They recovered well, though, securing a 9 wicket win in their next Championship game, against Derbyshire, and then won a closely fought game by 16 runs against Nottinghamshire. On 17 May Worcestershire were eliminated from the C&G Trophy in the Second Round by Yorkshire. An important win came away at Essex in the fifth game in the Championship, before they lost to Glamorgan Dragons in the National League.\n\nJune started with a draw in the Championship against Division Two leaders, Durham, before Worcestershire became the first English side to lose to Bangladesh, in a one-day match at New Road. And that poor form continued, losing at Leicestershire in the Championship despite being on top for most of the match, and then being bowled out for 164 to lose a match with Essex by 39 runs in the National League.\n\nIn Twenty20, however, they found a way to recover, beating local rivals Warwickshire – it did not last long, though, because losses to Somerset and Gloucestershire followed. In fact, their only positives in the Twenty20 Cup were the two one-run victories over Warwickshire, as every other match apart from their last one with Glamorgan Dragons ended without a victory – and the last one was academic anyway. The Championship did not give any relief, either, as they lost to Yorkshire by three wickets, before Glamorgan got the better of them in the National League, where Worcestershire had now slumped to last place.\n\nThey also became the first team to lose to Northamptonshire in the Championship, as they relinquished their play-off spot with an 82-run loss. They recovered well in the National League, though, beating Gloucestershire by 20 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method, before rain resulted in a no-result against Hampshire Hawks. A three-day match with the touring Australians ended in a draw, having been shortened to two days due to rain.\n\nAugust started with two losses to Northamptonshire Steelbacks – one in the National League and one in the Championship. After an eight-day break from cricket, Worcestershire came back strongly, though, amassing 696 for 8 declared and beating Somerset by an innings, which meant they could entertain a small hope of promotion. A mixed bag of results with a win and a loss in two games in the National League followed before a Championship match with Lancashire, which they lost by an innings and 73 runs. The month ended with a home draw with Leicestershire.\n\nWorcestershire moved out of the National League relegation zone with a victory over Gloucestershire on the first Sunday in September, before a draw with Yorkshire put them further adrift of a promotion spot in the Championship. Their National League luck was short-lived too, as they lost to Nottinghamshire and Essex on successive week-ends, leaving them precariously placed before their last match of the season – which would be a virtual play-off match against Lancashire. First, however, they drew with Essex in the Championship, before National League relegation was a fact thanks to a 75-run loss to Lancashire.\n\nTables\n\nChampionship\n\ntotesport League\n\nMatch details\n\nDerbyshire v Worcestershire (13–16 April)\n\nWorcestershire (21pts) beat Derbyshire (3pts) by 10 wickets\n\nAt Derby, Worcestershire won the toss and chose to bat. Stephen Moore was run out early for 19. He held his pose, showing off his defensive shot during an appeal for leg before wicket, as Moss came in on the blind side and threw the ball at the stumps. The other opener, Stephen Peters, stayed around though, and made 55. Once Moore was out, Peters was joined by Graeme Hick, who was given lives on 8 and 57, and made 80 off 119 balls before finally being lbw for 80 off one that kept low. Vikram Solanki then went for a duck, but Worcestershire were never in trouble, finishing on 305 for 6 at close.\n\nWorcestershire kept batting on the second day, before declaring after winning their fourth bonus point on 350 for 9. Derbyshire's batting was woeful, with no-one scoring more than 30 as their first innings ended on 135 all out, 215 behind. Matthew Mason, who took two wickets and a bowling analysis of 10–6–6–2, Alamgir Sheriyar and David Wigley, who took three each, were the main contributors with ball in hand for Worcester. The follow-on was enforced, and Derbyshire were 10 for 0 when stumps were drawn.\n\nOnly 74 overs were bowled on the third day, with rain ending play at tea. Michael di Venuto put up the Derbyshire resistance, scoring 111 in an innings that included 12 fours and 1 six before finally being stumped off Gareth Batty. Steve Stubbings played the anchor role, and had made only 33 when the first wicket fell for 150. Batty bowled unchanged for a 32 over spell as Sheriyar and Wigley tried, and failed, to get di Venuto. Once he was gone, there was a flurry of wickets to 175 for 4. At close Derbyshire were within sight of a draw, being 11 runs behind with six wickets remaining.\n\nGareth Batty increased his second innings tally to 5 for 87 to dismiss Derbyshire early on the fourth day, as Stubbings' innings ended with just 10 added to the previous day's score for a total of 58. By the time they were all out for 285, Derbyshire had set a target of just 71 in 68 overs. It took them only 14 as Peters and Moore won the match for them by 10 wickets. It was an easy victory for Worcestershire in the end, helped by Derbyshire dropping 6 catches along the way. Worcester coach Tom Moody said, 'We haven't got our overseas players here but this was a good example of the depth of our squad. To have a successful season, you need players who can come in and stand up and be counted and they've done that. The game proved that catches win matches with Derbyshire dropping six while Worcestershire hardly missed an opportunity. We were let off the hook a bit in the first innings with some dropped chances but our catching was exceptional, particularly with the conditions being so cold. I think the cold weather was the hardest thing for Gareth [Batty] because it's difficult for a spinner to get his hands warm and grip the ball.' (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nNorthamptonshire v Worcestershire (17 April)\n\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 31 runs (D/L method)\n\nAt Northampton, Worcestershire Royals captain Vikram Solanki led from the front, scoring 119 off 137 balls, including 13 fours and 1 six. Support from his colleagues took the visitors up to 211 for 4 off their 45 overs. Worcestershire director of cricket Tom Moody said of Solanki: 'I can't see why he won't be in the mix for England section this summer. It depends how the selectors shuffle the deck, but I would imagine he will be in their minds for consideration at the very least. We were very confident he was ready for the challenge of captaincy and he has had a great start.'\n\nWhen Northampstonshire Steelbacks batted, Australian Matt Mason took 3 for 20, to leave Northamptonshire on 137 for 7 off 32.5 overs when rain prevented further play. Worcestershire won easily on the Duckworth-Lewis method. (BBC scorecard)\n\nDurham v Worcestershire (20–21 April)\n\nDurham (19pts) beat Worcestershire (3pts) by 7 wickets\n\nWorcestershire won the toss at Chester-le-Street and chose to bat first. Stephen Peters and Stephen Moore started them off well as they moved to 75 without loss. Then Mark Davies, who is fighting for his first-team place, took six wickets to reduce them to 120, before Steve Harmison (3 wickets) and Paul Collingwood (1 wicket) finished off the tail to reduce Worcestershire to 171 all out. Collingwood then returned with the bat and got to 88 not out, to leave Durham well-placed on 139 for 2 at close.\n\nOn the second day, Collingwood completed his century, finally falling for 129 when Durham were 229 for 4. The Durham tail did not back up the start given to them by the specialist batsmen, however, and they were all out for 286, a lead of 115. Liam Plunkett, who had a good first game but a quiet first innings in this second game, then returned to knock out three top-order wickets. The rest of the bowling unit performed well, and Steve Harmison took a hat-trick on his way to 5 for 61. Harmison later said, 'The way I was feeling, my tail was up and I felt I could go through them. The position they were in I don’t think they were too keen to hang around. Before the last ball [of the hat-trick], I felt confident. It was a decent ball in a decent area and I was glad when he [David Wigley] chopped it on.'\n\nChaminda Vaas top-scored with 42 not out, as Worcester were all out for 146. This left Durham a target of only 32 to win, which they got for the loss of 3 wickets to win with two days spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Lancashire (27–30 April)\n\nLancashire (17pts) beat Worcestershire (6pts) by 76 runs\n\nLancashire batted first after losing the toss at Worcester, and were soon in trouble. At 81 for 3, Andrew Flintoff, playing his first first-class match after returning from injury, came to the crease. However, after facing 5 balls he was back in the Pavilion without scoring. It got worse for Lancashire as they fell to 97 for 6 and 196 all out, mostly thanks to an unbeaten 69 from wicket-keeper Warren Hegg. In reply, Worcestershire lost Stephen Moore early, but Graeme Hick and Stephen Peters were there at close, with Worcestershire on 59 for 1.\n\nHick dominated the second day's play as he moved from 32 not out to 176 in 231 balls, his 127th first-class century and his 97th for Worcestershire. This now puts him tenth in the list of all-time century makers, just ahead of WG Grace. However, no other Worcester player scored more than 27 as Muttiah Muralitharan picked up 5 wickets, and they finished on 306, 110 ahead. Lancashire were 47 for 1 in reply at stumps.\n\nThere was cheer for England fans on the third day, as the England regular Flintoff was back to his belligerent best, scoring 83 from 101 balls. Stuart Law also made 83, but was slower, taking 152 balls. With support from Dominic Cork (57), Lancashire were able to set a fair target. Their 377 left Worcestershire 268 to win. They lost Peters first ball, and Moore also fell, but with Lancashire pitching short to Hick, it was 58 for 2 at close.\n\nOn the final day, 3 wickets from each of Dominic Cork and Muttiah Muralitharan helped dismiss Worcestershire for 191 runs, with David Wigley unable to bat because of a broken hand sustained when James Anderson bowled a beamer at him in the first innings. After the match Cork talking about his match performance of 7 for 115 said, 'The ball is coming out well at the moment. I've worked hard with Mike Watkinson over the winter with it. It's early season and these sort of conditions suit a bowler like myself.' Watkinson, in response, spoke of Lancashire's determination to get straight back into the first Division after the disappointment of relegation last season, ''We talked about the start of the season and the need to start well and to get a positive number in the wins column is a good feeling. We have two home games now coming up against Derbyshire and Durham and maybe we can kick on from here.' (BBC scorecard)\n\nMiddlesex v Worcestershire (1 May)\n\nMiddlesex (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 3 wickets (D/L method)\n\nThe Worcestershire Royals put on 201 for 7 in their 44 overs, with David Leatherdale making 72 from 83 balls in an innings in which Graeme Hick became the heaviest scorer in the Sunday League's history. New Zealander Scott Styris took 3 wickets for Middlesex Crusaders, and kept the visitors from scoring freely. Middlesex made heavy work of overturning this total, even though they had 104 on the board before the first wicket fell. But ultimately they retained their 100% Sunday League record with 3 wickets and 1 over left. (BBC scorecard)\n\nScotland v Worcestershire (4–5 May)\n\nWorcestershire beat Scotland by 10 wickets to progress to Round Two of the C&G Trophy\n\nThe first day at The Grange saw no play because of rain. After losing the toss, Scotland were put in, and the bowlers immediately made it very difficult for Scotland. It took them six overs to make their first ten runs, and every time they tried to accelerate, they lost wickets. In the end, they could only muster 134 all out in 46.5 overs. Vikram Solanki and Stephen Moore made this target look easy, passing the required 135 runs without losing a wicket in 5 balls fewer than 20 overs. Both batsmen made half-centuries. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Loughborough UCCE (8–10 May)\n\nLoughborough UCCE beat Worcestershire by 8 wickets\n\nLoughborough UCCE had a good first day at Kidderminster, putting on 233 for the loss of 4 wickets. Loughborough's Richard Clinton, who also played thirteen first class games for Surrey this season, made 106, and put on 197 for the first wicket with Edward Foster. They then went on to dominate Worcestershire on the second day. After declaring on 304 for 6, Steven Clark took 5 for 29 as the county team was dismissed for a miserly 133 – with four batsmen, including both openers, making ducks. Only two Worcestershire players, Zander de Bruyn (81) and Jamie Pipe (23) reached double figures. Worcester made 68 for 2 following-on by stumps on the second day.\n\nThe third day saw the students wrap up a convincing victory, dismissing Worcestershire for 209 before rattling off the winning runs to finish on 41 for 2. This gave Loughborough UCCE their first first-class win since they were given first-class status three years ago, and represents the second win for a student side of the season (after Bradford/Leeds UCCE beat Surrey). (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Derbyshire (11–14 May)\n\nWorcestershire (22pts) beat Derbyshire (5pts) by 9 wickets\n\nWorcestershire's Stephen Moore dominated the first innings, making 246 as they climbed to 478. The score would have been a lot less if it weren't for Jamie Pipe, who came in with the score on 300 for 8 and put on 80, sharing a 173-run stand with Moore – eight short of the county ninth-wicket record from 1907. In reply Derbyshire were bowled out for 263, with no player making a half-century. The follow-on was enforced and Derbyshire did do better, but their 314 set Worcester a target of 100, which they easily knocked off for the loss of one wicket. Derbyshire's second innings included 7 lbws. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Nottinghamshire (15 May)\n\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by 16 runs\n\nNottinghamshire Outlaws recorded their fourth successive loss, this time at New Road to Worcestershire. It was the Africans who made the most impact, as Zander de Bruyn's 62 laid the foundation for a target of 191 that was to become too large for the visitors, while the exiled Zimbabwean spinner Ray Price took four wickets for 21. With Nottinghamshire's overseas players, Stephen Fleming (5) and David Hussey (2) being removed early by Sri Lankan fast bowler Chaminda Vaas, the visitors were in trouble, and Price and de Bruyn – who came on first and second change – tied them down effectively, with 4–21 and 0–20 respectively. Even Paul Franks' and Gareth Clough's late attempts at hitting runs backfired, and Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 174.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nYorkshire v Worcestershire (17 May)\n\nYorkshire beat Worcestershire by 14 runs to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C&G Trophy\n\nYorkshire batted first at Headingley and fared poorly at first, slumping to 88 for 4 when Michael Vaughan cut the ball from Zander de Bruyn onto his stumps. Craig White and Anthony McGrath then put on 83 in 22 overs, and late hitting gave Yorkshire a defendable total of 241 for 9 with 52 off the last 5 overs. The Worcestershire innings followed a similar course. First they were reduced to 50 for 3, and then Kabir Ali (67) and Zander de Bruyn (82) came together, putting on 117. White then interrupted them, taking three wickets. The run-chase was thus effectively curtailed, and Worcestershire finished well behind on 227 for 8. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nEssex v Worcestershire (20–23 May)\n\nWorcestershire (21pts) beat Essex (4pts) by eight wickets\n\nEssex and Worcestershire took notice of the bad weather forecasts, racking up runs swiftly at Chelmsford. The Essex batting effort was not very spectacular, and only Ronnie Irani's 85 saved some grace for Essex as wickets tumbled amid showers on the first day. They finished 220 all out as Worcestershire's bowlers teamed up, Matthew Mason the best with four for 48. In reply, Ben Smith made a century including fourteen fours, and with help of Gareth Batty (54) and Kabir Ali (53), both former England players, Worcestershire got to 383 all out – a lead of 163. Alastair Cook, Essex' 20-year-old prodigy, made a quick 46, but it was their 37-year-old Zimbabwean Andy Flower who, as so many times before, was the top scorer and the rock of the Essex innings with 85 – which led them to 329.\n\nSetting Worcestershire a paltry 167 to win, Essex got off to a good start bowling, removing opener Stephen Peters for 0 and nightwatchman and wicketkeeper Jamie Pipe for 11 just before stumps, as Darren Gough and Dale Steyn took a wicket each for Essex. On the fourth day, however, Stephen Moore built on his good batting form after 246 against Derbyshire a week before, however, making 63 not out and pairing up with Graeme Hick (76 not out) for 146 runs to win the match with relative ease.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nGlamorgan v Worcestershire (27 May)\n\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 53 runs\n\nDavid Hemp gave Glamorgan Dragons a much needed win in the National League against Worcestershire Royals, as his 65 lifted the team to an unchasable 227. Despite three run outs, Glamorgan were rather pleased with their innings, but probably more pleased with their bowling – everyone got wickets, and the great batsman of the innings Zander de Bruyn, who made 51, was eventually frustrated enough to get run out. Former England U-19 player David Harrison notched up his second List A career five-wicket-haul, taking five for 33.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Middlesex (30 May)\n\nMiddlesex (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 32 runs\n\nMiddlesex Crusaders were lifted by a massive 160-run partnership between New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris and former England Test player Ed Smith as they assembled 224 for 7 in a rain-shortened match at Worcester, in which Worcestershire's bowlers delivered six maiden overs. However, Worcestershire Royals' reply were hampered by wickets falling everywhere, along with lack of responsibility to keep the run-rate up, as Vikram Solanki made 40 off 66 balls and Zander de Bruyn 55 off 74 – too slow to chase 225 in 44 overs. When Gareth Batty was run out, a rot set in, as Worcestershire lost five wickets for 15 runs and were forced to crawl to 192 for 9.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Durham (1–4 June)\n\nWorcestershire (9pts) drew with Durham (9pts)\n\nThe first day at Worcester was washed out by rain. Durham batted to 256 when they finally got a chance to bat on the second day, but more rain meant Worcestershire could only get to 226 for 7 at close on the third day, and a draw was a formality. This was confirmed with the innings closing at 267 all out, and Durham chose not to chase a victory, declaring on 180 for 2 with Paul Collingwood on 103 not out when stumps were drawn on the final day. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nSomerset v Worcestershire (8–11 June)\n\nWorcestershire (22pts) beat Somerset (8pts) by eight wickets\n\nHaving won the toss and chosen to bat first at Bath, Somerset made 408 in the first innings including 127 by Matthew Wood and 55 by South Africa's Graeme Smith, captaining the side. Worcestershire put on 423 in reply, Ben Smith going on to make 140 and Stephen Moore 86 after both were dropped at slip in double figures by Ian Blackwell. Andrew Caddick took five for 132 in a 31-over effort for Somerset. Worcestershire then cemented their control over the game by dismissing Somerset for 152 in the second innings, with Matt Mason taking 5 for 34. The Worcestershire batsmen achieved the target of 138 for the loss of just 2 wickets, Moore making his second fifty of the match with an unbeaten 66. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Bangladeshis (12 June)\n\nThe Bangladeshis beat Worcestershire by four wickets\n\nBangladesh recorded their first victory of their tour of England when they beat Worcestershire at The County Ground, Worcester. In a disciplined bowling effort, Nazmul Hossain took two early wickets, Worcestershire collapsed to 168 (despite Bangladesh giving up 33 wides and 6 no-balls), and in a slow, gritty chase, the Bangladeshis – guided by Habibul Bashar's 26 not out and 43 from Javed Omar, made it to the target with 14 overs to spare.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nLeicestershire v Worcestershire (15–18 June)\n\nLeicestershire (18pts) beat Worcestershire (6pts) by 12 runs\n\nWorcestershire were on top of Leicestershire for three and a half days at Grace Road, yet lost the match. Despite Dinesh Mongia scoring a quickfire 66, Leicestershire could only scamper 225 in their first innings, Ray Price taking three for 29 with economical off-spin and Nadeem Malik taking his fourth career five-wicket-haul. In reply, Worcestershire made 323, young batsman Daryl Mitchell making a gruelling 63 not out in five hours while Zander de Bruyn top-scored with 67. Leicestershire then collapsed to 149 for 8, thanks to tight bowling from Price who got four wickets, but experienced wicketkeeper Paul Nixon lifted them with a fine 85 before being run out. The last two partnerships added 89 runs, lifting Worcestershire's target to 141 in about 50 overs – very gettable in most cases. And when Worcestershire were 95 for 4 with the two young batsmen Steven Davies and Mitchell at the crease, it still looked possible. But Davies trod on his wicket attempting to pull a short ball, Mitchell was lbw to Mongia, Ray Price was run out for a five-ball duck, and despite double-figure scores from Chaminda Vaas and Matt Mason Worcestershire fell thirteen short of their target.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Essex (19 June)\n\nEssex (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 39 runs\n\nIn a low-scoring match at New Road in Worcester, Essex Eagles prevailed to take a four-point lead into the month-long break in the National League, defending 203 for 9 with relative ease. Having won the toss, skipper Ronnie Irani was the first victim of the Worcestershire Royals bowling with a three-ball duck. Chaminda Vaas and Ray Price got two wickets each as Essex' batting faltered, but 34 from Ryan ten Doeschate saved the visitors. Worcestershire started positively, Graeme Hick and Stephen Moore pairing up for 66 for the first wicket, but part-timer William Jefferson removed both of them in quick succession to start the Worcestershire rot. With only Stephen Peters surviving hostile bowling, scoring 41 not out, Worcestershire eventually finished on 164 all out.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Warwickshire (22 June)\n\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one run\n\nIn the local battle at New Road, Worcestershire Royals eked out a victory over rivals Warwickshire Bears. Graeme Hick and Ben Smith both made big scores, with 67 and 47, and skipper Gareth Batty also made 21 to send Worcestershire to 177 for 7. Warwickshire then collapsed to accurate bowling, losing their entire top order except Jonathan Trott to end up on 68 for 5 – but Michael Powell made 40 not out batting at seven, turning the innings almost back to Warwickshire's favour. In the end, however, they were two runs short, their No. 11 Nick Warren only managing to hit one off the two balls he faced.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nSomerset v Worcestershire (23 June)\n\nSomerset (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 15 runs\n\nDespite captain Graeme Smith becoming victim of Zander de Bruyn's bowling for just two runs, Somerset Sabres still posted a big target, thanks to Matthew Wood, who made 94 off only 35 balls before falling to Nadeem Malik six short of a century. Wood's smashing helped the Sabres to 210 for 6, although no other batsman passed 30. Graeme Hick tried to emulate Wood, but could only make 87 before Ian Blackwell got the better of him, and from then on Worcestershire never really had a chance. Blackwell finished with two for 20 in his four overs, and could take his share of the honour for Somerset's surprising win.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nGloucestershire v Worcestershire (26 June)\n\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nThis was a game of two batsmen. After Simon Kirby had ripped out two Worcestershire Royals wickets early on, to finish with figures of two for 15 from four overs, the Royals had been 24 for 3. Zander de Bruyn then hit eight fours and three sixes in his 76 not out, lifting the Royals to 162 for 6 and setting a potentially tricky target. However, William Weston replied with 73 not out of his own, and despite only Craig Spearman passing 20 of the other batsmen, Weston secured a win for Gloucestershire with two balls to spare.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Northamptonshire (27 June)\n\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 37 runs\n\nDavid Sales (59 runs) and Usman Afzaal (46) lifted Northamptonshire Steelbacks to a very competitive total of 180 for 6 at New Road, where Shoaib Akhtar bowled a maiden over but was smashed for thirty-three runs in the other three overs he bowled. The hosts' innings saw Worcestershire Royals lose Graeme Hick early on, and despite 53 from Stephen Moore, Northamptonshire's bowlers had a good grip on the Worcestershire players – Johann Louw got the best figures for the Steelbacks with three for 25 – and Worcestershire finished on 143 for 8.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWarwickshire v Worcestershire (1 July)\n\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one run\n\nWorcestershire Royals took their second successive one-run victory over Warwickshire Bears, to the agony of home fans at Edgbaston. After Heath Streak took two early wickets, Neil Carter entered the scene as the sixth bowler to be used. He took five wickets inside four overs, for 19 runs, as Worcestershire were all out for 141 with seven balls to spare. In reply, two run outs and wickets from Gareth Batty and Zander de Bruyn left Warwickshire trailing by 60 with one wicket in hand, with Heath Streak and James Anyon at the crease. Streak rotated the strike well, facing most of the balls and hitting most of the runs, and brought the score to 140 for 9 with a ball to spare. Then – setting off for the last run that would tie the scores (and win the match for Warwickshire on fewer wickets lost) – Streak was run out for 59, off 32 balls, and Warwickshire's quarter-final hopes were dented, but not wiped out.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Gloucestershire (2 July)\n\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by nine wickets\n\nThe visitors Gloucestershire Gladiators recorded an easy victory at New Road as Worcestershire scored only 100 all out in their innings, Stephen Moore top-scoring with only 23. Martyn Ball took three for 24, but all the bowlers got wickets, and Mark Alleyne conceded only six runs in four overs. Although they lost Craig Spearman with the score on 22, the Gladiators knocked off their target easily, with nine wickets and five overs to spare.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nNorthamptonshire v Worcestershire (5 July)\n\nMatch abandoned; Northamptonshire (1pt), Worcestershire (1pt)\n\nNo play was possible at The County Ground, Northampton due to rain, and the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks qualified for the quarter-finals thanks to the no-result.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Glamorgan (6 July)\n\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 37 runs\n\nBoth Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were knocked out before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from amassing one of the highest scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 – Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar – who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always too much to ask, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Yorkshire (8–11 July)\n\nYorkshire (20pts) beat Worcestershire (4pts) by three wickets\n\nYorkshire closed the gap to the promotion spots from 6.5 to 1.5 points after a three-wicket win at New Road over Worcestershire. Matthew Hoggard got a good return to form after being smashed out of the Twenty20 format with an economy rate of 11, taking three for 68 in Worcestershire's first innings, yet the hosts made 345 before being bowled out shortly before stumps on day 1. Richard Pyrah, playing his first first-class game of the season, and Craig White then rescued Yorkshire from 113 for 4 with fifties, but Nadeem Malik and Kabir Ali finished with three wickets each to get them all out for 300, trailing by 45. Then, Tim Bresnan took two early wickets before stumps, and continued on day three to end with career-best figures of five for 42. However, another England prospect, Kabir Ali, took four more wickets, as Yorkshire were 222 for 6 overnight – needing 46 runs to win. They lost wicket-keeper Ismail Dawood early, but were not pegged back further, and Richard Dawson made 51 not out to lead them to the target. Worcestershire were also docked two points for a slow over rate.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Glamorgan (17 July)\n\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nWorcestershire Royals would be ruing lost opportunities after the game with Glamorgan Dragons at New Road. Winning the toss and batting first, captain Vikram Solanki paired up for 91 with Stephen Moore, who would go on to make 104. Zander de Bruyn also made an unbeaten fifty to lift Worcestershire to 273 for 3. The Indian international Sourav Ganguly was the only Glamorga bowler to come out with some credit, as he got one wicket for 19 in his five overs. Worcestershire started creditably, snaring the wicket of Robert Croft in the second over, but Glamorgan sent out another pinch-hitter in Alex Wharf who made 38 before he was bowled bu David Leatherdale who took two for 35. However, Sourav Ganguly with 53, Michael Powell with 82, and David Hemp with an unbeaten 51 off 36 balls chased down the target. The Glamorgan batsman took a particular liking to England Test spinner Gareth Batty who finished wicketless for 69 runs.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nNorthamptonshire v Worcestershire (20–23 July)\n\nNorthamptonshire (19pts) beat Worcestershire (6.5pts) by 82 runs\n\nWorcestershire's fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had a field day despite serving up no balls on the first day at Northampton, but that was only the first day, and Northamptonshire came back to win the game. The match had started well enough for the hosts Northamptonshire, but a menacing spell from the Pakistani fast bowler reduced them from 150 for 2 to 173 for 8 – Matt Mason helping out with two wickets as well. Shoaib finished with six for 47, including twenty runs conceded due to no-balls – while Monty Panesar and Jason Brown rescued the hosts to 299 with a last-wicket stand of 62. Young wicket-keeper Steve Davies then made a career-best 95 in his sixth first-class game, which helped lift Worcestershire to 381, a lead of 82.\n\nNorthamptonshire lost six wickets to spinners in their second innings, Ray Price and Gareth Batty taking three each while Shoaib was expensive, conceding 67 in thirteen overs, as Northamptonshire were bowled out for 364 – Bilal Shafayat making 84 and Riki Wessels 102. Chasing 283 to win, Worcestershire got off to a good start with an opening partnership of 54, but Northamptonshire's spinner Monty Panesar took three for 47 to leave them 139 for 5 overnight, Ben Smith unbeaten on 50. Smith only added seven to that score, while Panesar took three more wickets, bowling 26.5 overs in one straight spell which yielded six for 77. Johann Louw and Brown also got one wicket each, as Worcestershire succumbed for 200 to suffer their third successive Championship loss, which sent them out of the promotion zone. Worcestershire were also deducted half a point for a slow over rate.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nGloucestershire v Worcestershire (24 July)\n\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 20 runs (D/L method)\n\nDespite being strengthened by their new acquisition from the West Indies, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Gloucestershire Gladiators still went down at Bristol. Having been put in to bat by Worcestershire Royals after rain delayed the start, Kabir Ali dug out a wicket with his first ball, and despite 51 from Matthew Windows Gloucestershire still only posted 168 for 9. In reply, Vikram Solanki and Stephen Moore batted 12.4 overs without loss before rain intervened, and Worcestershire were then 20 runs ahead of their Duckworth/Lewis target.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nHampshire v Worcestershire (26 July)\n\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled; Hampshire (2pts), Worcestershire (2pts)\n\nAt Rose Bowl, Southampton it was not possible to play cricket due to rain, and the two teams Hampshire Hawks and Worcestershire Royals walked away with two points each.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Australians (30 July-1 August)\n\nMatch drawn\n\nThe first day only allowed one over of play, after Vikram Solanki sent Australia in to bat and Justin Langer hit a four off Kabir Ali. On the second day, Langer and Matthew Hayden accumulated 110 for the first wicket, and runs just kept flowing as the Australians made 402 in a day – Brad Haddin top-scoring with 94, Jason Gillespie making an unbeaten 53 including two sixes, while Nadeem Malik got the best bowling figures three wickets for 78. Ali, meanwhile, was punished, to end with 124 conceded runs in 20 overs.\n\nWorcestershire got off to a good start on the final day, Stephen Moore and Solanki making 85 for the fourth wicket after Jason Gillespie shook the top order early on. However, Michael Kasprowicz took four quick wickets as Worcestershire imploded from 133 for 3 to 151 for 9, while a bit of late order slogging from James Pipe and Malik sent the score to 187. Malik was last out, caught and bowled by Kasprowicz to complete the Australian's five-wicket-haul and mark the end of the Worcestershire innings. Australian captain Ricky Ponting opted for batting practice, and the Australians made 168 for 2 before stumps, Ponting scoring an unbeaten 59 while Michael Clarke, who was promoted to opener, also repaired a first-innings failure, making 59 off 55 balls before being run out.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Northamptonshire (2 August)\n\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 38 runs\n\nUsman Afzaal scored 117 off just 103 balls as Northamptonshire Steelbacks ploughed their way to 275 for 4, Afzaal pairing up with Martin Love for the second wicket for a partnership that was worth 155 runs. The Royals' innings struggled from the outset, when Stephen Moore was dismissed for a duck, and despite 52 from Graeme Hick, Worcestershire imploded to 185 for 9 at one point, with Bilal Shafayat taking four for 33 with medium-pace bowling. In the final overs, Shoaib Akhtar had some hitting fun at the end, scoring 36 off 17 balls in vain as Worcestershire ended on 237 for 9.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Northamptonshire (4–7 August)\n\nNorthamptonshire (17pts) beat Worcestershire (3pts) by 137 runs\n\nWorcestershire gave away the initiative in the second innings, losing by 137 runs thanks to a frantic second-innings 190 from David Sales. It was the visitors, Northamptonshire, who chose to bat first at New Road, and after seeing off Shoaib Akhtar and Kabir Ali in a frantic opening spell where Bilal Shafayat went for 1, Northamptonshire looked fairly confident at 177 for 4. Then Shoaib returned, taking four wickets (to end with bowling figures of 9.2–1–55–5), and the wheels fell off as Northamptonshire lost their last six wickets for 12 runs. Stephen Moore continued his fine form, making 62, as Worcestershire looked to gain a slender lead – Ben Phillips taking a couple of wickets to give Northamptonshire some hope of tying the hosts down. Then, Damien Wright ripped through with some quick wickets, as Worcestershire went from 110 for 3 to 147 for 8 – only for Shoaib and Matthew Mason to give Worcestershire the lead thanks to a boundary-filled 47-run partnership.\n\nAli and Mason then chipped away at the Northamptonshire batsmen, and would have fancied their chances when the visitors were 64 for 5. However, a quickfire partnership between Sales and Wright turned the match on its head again, as the pair added 188 runs in 112 minutes – one run less than Northamptonshire had managed in the entire first innings – to send Northamptonshire into a relatively big lead on this pitch. Sales was 152 not out overnight, and powered on to 190 before Malik had him caught. However, the damage was done, and Worcestershire faced a steep target of 360 to win – or five sessions for a draw. Losing Moore and Graeme Hick early on, Ben Smith attacked for a fine 92, and a 45-minute flurry of runs from Zander de Bruyn gave Worcestershire some hope at 154 for 3. However, Monty Panesar got four for 40, Phillips dug out three for 56, Worcestershire lost the last seven wickets for 68 runs, and whimpered into a heap. Worcestershire were later docked one point due to a slow over rate.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Somerset (16–19 August)\n\nWorcestershire (22pts) beat Somerset (4pts) by an innings and 56 runs\n\nSomerset were bowled out for 318 on the first day at New Road, but for the efforts of Malaysian Arul Suppiah (who made 72), wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard (74) and the 18-year-old debutant from Taunton, Robert Woodman (46 not out), it would have been far worse. The Worcestershire bowlers shared out the wickets, and Somerset were in real trouble at 57 for 5, but Suppiah stayed calm and the lower order made good contributions. Nadeem Malik got the best figures for Worcestershire, with three for 63.\n\nHowever, Somerset's bowling left something to be desired. After an opening stand of 51, Worcestershire powered onwards, with number three Zander de Bruyn smashing 28 fours in a four-hour 161. Ben Smith and Steve Davies also got centuries, as Worcestershire at one point were 618 for 3. Three wickets from Keith Parsons set them back, but Worcestershire could still declaration and forfeiture declare on 696 for 8. Suppiah started well once again, making 34 in a 110-run partnership with Matthew Wood as Somerset made their way to 138 for 1. Then spinners Ray Price and Gareth Batty shared the next seven wickets for 70 runs, and Somerset imploded to 209 for 8 while still needing 169 to avoid the innings defeat. A good rearguard from number eight Carl Gazzard, and his partners Andy Caddick and Simon Francis saw Somerset first past 250 and then past 300. They looked to make Worcestershire bat again when Kabir Ali had Francis bowled – his only wicket of the innings, as he finished with expensive figures of 8.5–0–50–1. Batty and Price bowled 87 of Worcestershire's total of 108.5 overs, and Price's 44 overs included 21 maidens.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Hampshire (22 August)\n\nHampshire (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by four wickets\n\nHampshire Hawks got the four points from a closely fought match at New Road. Worcestershire Royals had won the toss and chosen to bat, and their innings was shortened to 34 overs out of a scheduled 45 due to rain. Wickets fell regularly, four batsmen being dismissed with scores in the thirties, and the final score of 185 for 7 did not look too threatening. John Crawley and Shane Watson put Hampshire back on track after two early wickets from Kabir Ali shook them, but an economical spell from Ray Price which yielded two wickets was nearly enough. However, the other spinner Gareth Batty was not nearly as economical, and Greg Lamb took him for runs to end with 16 not out and win the game for Hampshire.\n\nLancashire v Worcestershire (24 August)\n\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by four wickets\n\nChris Gayle, Worcestershire's new overseas player after Shoaib Akhtar left to play in the 2005 Afro-Asian Cup, helped Worcestershire Royals to an important victory in the National League, while Lancashire Lightning suffered their third one-day defeat in five days. Having won the toss and batted, Lancashire regularly lost wickets, and the innings of Australian Marcus North was symptomatic – he made a 19-ball 2. Stuart Law, however, scored 82, and was along with Glen Chapple the only batsman to really keep up the scoring rate. Lancashire could only muster a total of 195 for 9, and defending that target quickly became difficult ash Gayle slashed eight fours and a six on his way to a 41-ball 53. Despite Chapple's returns of 9–0–23–4 and Anderson taking two for 47, Worcestershire made it to the target with four wickets and 5.3 overs in hand.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nLancashire v Worcestershire (25–28 August)\n\nLancashire (22pts) beat Worcestershire (6pts) by an innings and 73 runs\n\nLancashire recorded an innings victory at Stanley Park in Blackpool against Worcestershire to go second in the Division Two table of the County Championship. Mal Loye and Stuart Law made centuries in the first innings, which became a very difficult one for the Worcestershire bowlers. On the second day, Worcestershire finally got some breakthroughs, as Loye was dismissed for 187 and North for 60, and Lancashire could declare with a total of 562 for 8. Chris Gayle played an innings in typical fashion, hitting eight fours from 25 deliveries before he was bowled by Dominic Cork for 43. Cork also got Graeme Hick for a duck, as Worcestershire closed the second day on 111 for 3. Ben Smith and Vikram Solanki fought back, however, pairing up for 140 for the fourth wicket, and Worcestershire looked confident of avoiding the follow-on with the score on 330 for 4. However, two wickets from Andrew Symonds and three from James Anderson ended the Worcestershire effort for 376, still trailing by 186.\n\nMark Chilton enforced the follow on, and things went from bad to worse for the visitors. No batsman passed 25, Glen Chapple got four wickets for Lancashire, and by the close Worcestershire were 112 for 9 – needing 72 to avoid an innings defeat. However, with the tenth ball of the fourth day Chapple dismissed Kabir Ali to end with five for 32, and Warwickshire were all out for 113.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Leicestershire (30 August-2 September)\n\nLeicestershire (12pts) drew with Worcestershire (9pts)\n\nOpener John Maunders batted for four hours for his first century of the first class season, and a further two hours to make a total of 148, which helped Leicestershire to a solid total of 407 at New Road – yet the slow nature of his batting meant there was little time to force a victory. Paul Nixon also hit a three-hour fifty for Leicestershire, while Kabir Ali got the best bowling figures with four for 95, including nine no-balls and one wide. Spinners Ray Price and Chris Gayle took a total of five wickets in their 32.1 overs, while both Shoaib Akhtar and Gareth Batty went wicketless. Worcestershire's batsmen all got starts, but not much more, and David Masters dug out both openers to end with three for 49 as Worcestershire were all out for 290 – Claude Henderson taking care of the last four wickets with nine balls, to end with four for 72 in the innings.\n\nLeicestershire lost both openers to Kabir Ali who took three wickets at a cost of more than five runs an over as Aftab Habib and Tom New hit plenty of runs off him. Habib made 90, as Leicestershire declared on 255 for 5, setting Worcestershire 371 in five hours, but the chase was halted by bad light. When it finally got underway, Worcestershire crashed to 87 for 4 after two wickets from Charl Willoughby, but fifties from Ben Smith and Gareth Batty saved the draw for Worcestershire.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Gloucestershire (4 September)\n\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by eight wickets\n\nA menacing spell from Shoaib Akhtar, who got six wickets for 16 runs, including the first five as Gloucestershire crashed to 22 for 5, left Gloucestershire Gladiators without any hope in the bottom-fight at New Road, Worcester. Akhtar's bowling analysis was the best in the National League all season. After Akhtar was taken off, Malinga Bandara and Mark Alleyne set about trying to bat out fifty overs, but Alleyne was caught by Worcestershire Royals' Vikram Solanki and Kabir Ali cleaned up the tail with two wickets as Gloucestershire were all out for 105. Bandara then got the wickets of Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki with successive deliveries, but Chris Gayle guided the hosts home with an unbeaten 53 off 70 balls, as Worcestershire won with more than 20 overs to spare.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nYorkshire v Worcestershire (7–10 September)\n\nYorkshire (10pts) drew with Worcestershire (8pts)\n\nRain wrecked the match at Headingley, a match which would probably have ended in a result if the normal 400 overs of play were possible instead of the 221.4 actually available. Although no batsman passed 50, Worcestershire accumulated 308 in 85 overs. Tim Bresnan took three wickets for 45 with his pace, while Australian Mark Cleary, playing in his first game for Yorkshire after a season with Leicestershire in 2004, had to be content with one man – Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar – while conceding 70. Anthony McGrath batted almost without support in Yorkshire's first innings, but his five-hour unbeaten 173 sent Yorkshire to a total of 317, despite struggling at 190 for 7 before Richard Dawson stepped in to make 49. Kabir Ali took four for 79 for Worcestershire, Nadeem Malik got three and Gareth Batty two, but they couldn't prevent the hosts racking up a nine-run lead.\n\nWorcestershire were then shaken by South African Deon Kruis who took the first three wickets in a frantic last session. Worcestershire hit at nearly a run a ball, ending the day with 126 off 24 overs, but lost four wickets in the process. Only 40 overs of play were possible on the third day, as Australians Cleary and Ian Harvey bowled Worcestershire out for 211. Yorkshire set about chasing 203 at a rapid pace, losing Matthew Wood and Joe Sayers but still making 125 for 2 in 25 overs before rain set in, shortening the day's play to five overs and ruining Yorkshire's chances as they needed 78 more with 8 wickets in hand. Worcestershire were later docked two points for a slow over rate.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nNottinghamshire v Worcestershire (11 September)\n\nNottinghamshire (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by five wickets\n\nDespite little help from the rest of the batting line-up, Ben Smith with 58 and Steven Davies and 43 gave Worcestershire Royals a total of 200, after Nottinghamshire Outlaws' Ryan Sidebottom had bowled four maiden overs and limited the scoring. Worcestershire made it to 200 for 9, however, but with Stephen Fleming making 73 in his first match for Nottinghamshire following the tour of Zimbabwe with the New Zealand team, Nottinghamshire made it to the target with five wickets in hand, despite Kabir Ali and Ray Price taking two wickets each.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nEssex v Worcestershire (18 September)\n\nEssex (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by four wickets\n\nEssex Eagles continued on their winning ways with their twelfth National League victory of the season, taking a win in the last over thanks to a 78-run stand between Grant Flower and Ravinder Bopara. However, it was Worcestershire Royals who won the toss and batted first, Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki (coming in for Chris Gayle who retired hurt) adding 103 for the first wicket. Gayle returned when Solanki was dismissed, hitting 44, and 25 from Ben Smith helped Worcestershire to 227 for 5. Andre Adams took three wickets as Worcestershire lost four for one solitary run, but Smith hung in there with number 11 Nadeem Malik and ensured a total of 240 for 9. Essex lost captain Ronnie Irani for nine early on, but a stroke-filled half-century from Alastair Cook sent Essex to 135 for 3, and Grant Flower then hit four sixes to complete a run-a-ball 81. Despite two late wickets from Kabir Ali, Bopara saw Essex home with five deliveries to spare to finish on 46 not out. \n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Essex (21–24 September)\n\nWorcestershire (11pts) drew with Essex (10pts)\n\nA total of 19 wickets fell in four days at New Road, despite only half a day being lost to rain. Batting first, Essex made 574 despite Stuart Wedge taking five for 112 in his second first class game, getting Ravinder Bopara as his first wicket. Essex got two early wickets; first class debutant Jahid Ahmed got his first wicket by removing 21-year-old Daryl Mitchell for 6, and Andre Adams bowled Graeme Hick, but Worcestershire's third-wicket partnership added 333, with Stephen Moore hitting 152 out of his 191 runs in boundaries. However, Worcestershire declared overnight on 424 for 3, and Essex scored 201 for one wicket in 36 overs, Alastair Cook rounding off his first season as an Essex regular with an unbeaten 117. Worcestershire were set 352 in 60 overs to win, and despite an 84-ball ton from Graeme Hick Worcestershire finished four runs short of the ten extra points a win would have given.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\nWorcestershire v Lancashire (25 September)\n\nLancashire (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 75 runs\n\nLancashire Lightning ensured continued survival in Division One of the National League with a victory over Worcestershire Royals in a rain-shortened match that was cut down from 45 to 33 overs. David Leatherdale and Gareth Batty took early wickets, as Lancashire lost their first four wickets for 65 runs, but Glen Chapple and Stuart Law added 84 for the fifth wicket, and Kyle Hogg also provided quick runs as Lancashire ended on 186 for 8. The six Lancashire bowlers then shared out wickets, as James Anderson ended with three for 12 including England batsman Vikram Solanki, while spinners Murali Kartik and Andrew Symonds took two each as Worcestershire were bowled out for 111. No Worcestershire batsman passed 25, and thus Worcestershire fell down into Division Two.\n(Cricinfo scorecard)\n\n2005 in English cricket\nWorcestershire County Cricket Club seasons"},

It is one of the oldest planned suburbs of the Cantonment, and was earlier known as Knoxpet, and  was later changed to Murphy Town. It is located North of Ulsoor, with Murphy Road running along its periphery, and is also bounded by Old Madras Road and Kensington Road, with part of Kensington Road overlooking Ulsoor Lake Madras Sappers.\n\nKnoxpet\nIn the early 1900s the suburb was known as Knoxpet, named after Lt. Col. Stuart George Knox, who served as Resident of Mysore and Coorg between 1 November 1921 to 31 October 1922, and earlier as Resident of Baroda State. The suburb was settled since 1865 by Tamil workers such as tannery workers, leather workers, pottery workers, etc. The houses at Knoxpet had poor sanitation facilities and generally poorly built, and resembled a slum. The Bangalore Plague of 1898, resulted in the government deciding to demolish, rebuild and re-settle the suburb. However actual process was started only in 1923. In 1937, the suburb was renamed as Murphy Town, after W H Murphy, MBE - Executive Engineer, Municipal Council, Bangalore Civil and Military Station.\n\nW H Murphy\nW H Murphy, served as the Executive Engineer, Municipal Council, Bangalore Civil and Military Station for nearly 25 years.  Murphy is credited with designing the sanitation works at Austin Town, and the underground drainage works at  (then known as BlackPalli).  He is responsible for designing and execution of some of Bangalore Cantonment's prominent buildings, such as Russell Market, which is named after T B Russell who served as Municipal Commissioner, Bangalore. He also designed and built the  Friend In Need Society and Colonel Hill High School, with buildings known as Cobb Home for the Aged (after H V Cobb, Resident of Mysore) and Girdlestone Nursing Home (after C E R Girdlestone, Resident of Mysore), inaugurated W P Barton (British Resident). Murphy was also credited with inventing the Dog Electrocute, which was used to kill stray dogs painlessly, and extensively used in the Bangalore Cantonment since November 1925. Murphy was also one of the founding members of the Rotary Club of Bangalore (founded 27 October 1934).\n\nTown plan\nCantonment records indicate that 310 single homes and 108 double homes were built, with cement, bricks and Mangalore tiles. There were large open quadrangles, and the houses were around its periphery, and these open spaces provided space for community and social functions. Space was also provided for Temples, Churches and a Market The housing scheme at Murphy Town was based on three defining principles. Firstly, the houses should be 'too good for the classes that occupy them' - the intention was to people to grain self-respect. Secondly, 'the dull uniformity of barracks' must not be implemented - as it proved to be a hindrance to social elevation. Finally, the houses were built with scope for further expansion if economic conditions improved.\n\nThe Houses had postal addresses named as 'SQUARE' (instead of Lane, Street or Cross) based on 9 numbers of the Squares consisting of Houses making it a Proper square, with Each of the 'SQUARE' having an Playground for recreational use of the Residents ( Hence you see the locality producing so many National level Footballers & Hockey Players even till date).\n\nResidents of Murphy Town\nLike in other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment, Murphy Town has a large Tamil population with Kannada & Telugu speaking Residents too. They trace their ancestry to the large number of Tamil soldiers, suppliers and workers who were brought into the Bangalore Civil and Military Station, by the British Army, after the fall of Tippu Sultan.It is said that half of the Tamil soldier ancestors of the Murphy town residents were from The Madras Sappers. Murphy Town along with other suburbs of the Bangalore Cantonment was directly under the administration of the British Madras Presidency till 1949, when it was handed over to the Mysore State.\n\nLike other poverty stricken areas of the world, Murphy Town, along with Austin Town has produced many good football players, with the sport being very popular in the suburb.this town has produced national & international Hockey players, coaches.\nEven today Free Football & Hockey coaching is conducted for kids.\nPrimrose Hockey Club One of the Oldest Private Hockey clubs in Karnataka was started here in 1959. There are some 37 houses in Murphy Town where the residents pay a nominal rent to BBMP, with the rates staying low as fixed by the British Authorities of the erstwhile Bangalore Cantonment. After independence, the residents met Murphy to get ownership papers, however these 37 houses were left without proper land papers. According to residents, they are still looked down as immigrants by government departments, even though they have been living in Bangalore than most other people in the city. The Street names in Murphy Town are named after Mudaliars, who were prominent businessmen in the community.\nThe Town Government School had produced several IAS officers, doctors, engineers, scientists, politicians, and teachers.\nFormer municipal councillor Shri Bhaskaran was elected several times as councillor and was honorary deputy mayor of Bangalore.\nUnder his guidance hundreds of old Murphy Town residents got B.D.A sites in Indira Nagar and Neighborood areas, many moved away to these new development areas( but they do a mandatory customary annual visit to celebrate Ulsoor pallike with their relatives & friends),\n\nThe local school bearing the plaque ‘1913 Elementary School’, used to a Tamil Medium School, which has now been converted to Kannada Medium. The school has an old dilapidated  building called the 'Evelyn Barton Welfare Centre’, which has since been closed as its too dangerous. According to the Principal of the School, local residents prefer to give their children English Medium Education from the numerous other schools nearby.\n\nThe Murphy Town Market is known for its Meat shops selling Chicken, Mutton, Beef and Fish. One of the shops in the Murphy Town Market, VM Stores is 100 years old, and is one of the oldest stores in the Market. Most of the shops 8x10 ft2, and the rent is minimal at INR 110. However, if a shop ownership is transferred, then the rent gets increased to INR 1000.\n\nPresent state\nIn November 2014, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike's (BBMP) decided to raze 18 old markets (including Murphy Town Market). This move has been opposed by heritage lovers, INTACH Bangalore and other groups. A campaign was being led by Kiran Natarajan, Bangalore's well known architect to stop the demolition of heritage markets.\n\nIn 1998, the BBMP renamed Murphy Town as Hoysala Nagar, after an ancient Kingdom which ruled the Deccan.

After overcoming skin cancer in 2014, Moore returned to football on loan at Queen's Park. He left Dundee United in 2015 and played for Irish club Limerick, before leaving full-time football in 2016 to focus on cancer awareness campaigning. Moore played for Kelty Hearts in the East of Scotland Football League after going part-time.\n\nPlaying career\nMoore was born in Glasgow and joined Dundee United at under-14 level. He was loaned to Scottish First Division side Airdrie United in February 2013 and scored on his debut from the penalty spot against Hamilton Academical in a 2–2 draw. He went on to make a total of nine appearances for Airdrie, scoring once more in a defeat away to Cowdenbeath before returning to Dundee United at the end of the season.\n\nMoore was once again loaned out for the 2013–14 season, this time to Scottish League One side Dunfermline Athletic where he was joined by fellow Dundee United players Ryan Ferguson and Luke Johnston. He made his debut for the club in a Scottish League Cup match on 3 August as a substitute for Ryan Wallace in the final three minutes of a 2–0 away win. Three weeks later he was given his first start for the club and scored twice as Dunfermline beat Stenhousemuir 5–4 away. He netted another brace on 2 November, in a 5–3 win at Elgin City, with two goals in a minute, the first a penalty which he won himself when fouled by David Niven.

{"id": "201685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senusiyya", "title": "Senusiyya", "text": "The Senusiyya, Senussi or Sanusi ( as-Sanūssiyya) are a Muslim political-religious tariqa (Sufi order) and clan in colonial Libya and the Sudan region founded in Mecca in 1837 by the Grand Senussi ( as-Sanūssiyy al-Kabīr), the Algerian Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi. Senussi was concerned with what he saw as both the decline of Islamic thought and spirituality and the weakening of Muslim political integrity.\n\nThe movement promoted strict adherence to Qur'an and Sunna, without partisanship to the traditional legal schools of thought. It also sought a reformation of Sufism, condemning various practices such as seeking help from the dead, sacrificing for them and other rituals which they considered to be superstitions and innovations. \n\nFrom 1902 to 1913, the Senussi fought French colonial expansion in the Sahara and the Kingdom of Italy's colonisation of Libya beginning in 1911. In World War I, they fought the Senussi Campaign against the British in Egypt and Sudan. In 1923, indigenous rebels associated with the Senussi Order organized the Libyan resistance movement against Italian settlement in Libya. During World War II, the Senussi tribe provided vital support to the British Eighth Army in North Africa against Nazi German and Fascist Italian forces. The Grand Senussi's grandson became King Idris of Libya in 1951. In 1969, Idris I was overthrown by a military coup led by Muammar Gaddafi. The movement remained active in spite of sustained persecution by Gaddafi's government. The Senussi spirit and legacy continue to be prominent in today's Libya, mostly in the east of the country.\n\nBeginnings: 1787–1859\n\nThe Senussi order has been historically closed to Europeans and outsiders, leading reports of their beliefs and practices to vary immensely. Though it is possible to gain some insight from the lives of the Senussi sheikhs further details are difficult to obtain.\n\nMuhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi (1787–1859), the founder of the order and a proponent of Sufism,  was born in Algeria near Mostaganem and was named al-Senussi after a venerated Muslim teacher. He was a member of the Walad Sidi Abdalla tribe, and was a sharif. In addition to Islamic sciences, Al-Senussi was taught science and chivalry in his upbringing. He studied at the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, then traveled in the Sahara preaching a purifying reform of the faith in Tunisia and Tripoli, gaining many adherents, and then moved to Cairo to study at Al-Azhar University in 1824. Al-Senussi was critical of the government of Muhammad Ali Pasha. The pious scholar was forceful in his criticism of the Egyptian ulama for what he perceived as their timid compliance with the Ottoman authorities and their spiritual conservatism.  He also argued that learned Muslims should not blindly follow the four classical madhhabs (schools of law) but instead engage in ijtihad themselves.  Not surprisingly, he was opposed by the ulama as unorthodox and they issued a fatwa against him. He left Egypt for Mecca, where he spent 15 years as a student and teacher until 1843.\n\nSenussi went to Mecca, where he joined Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi, the head of the Qadiriyya, a religious fraternity of Moroccan origin. On the death of al-Fasi, Senussi became head of one of the two branches into which the Qadiriyya divided, and in 1835 he founded his first monastery or zawiya, at Abu Qubays near Mecca. He returned to Libya in 1843, where in the mountains near Sidi Rafaa' (Bayda) he built the Zawiya Bayda ('White Monastery'). There he was supported by the local tribes and the Sultan of Wadai and his connections extended across the Maghreb.\n\nThe Grand Senussi did not tolerate fanaticism and forbade the use of stimulants as well as voluntary poverty.  Lodge members were to eat and dress within the limits of Islamic law and, instead of depending on charity, were required to earn their living through work. He accepted neither the wholly intuitive ways described by some Sufi mystics nor the rationality of some of the orthodox ulama; rather, he attempted to achieve a middle path. The Bedouin tribes had shown no interest in the ecstatic practices of the Sufis that were gaining adherents in the towns, but they were attracted in great numbers to the Senussis. The relative austerity of the Senussi message was particularly suited to the character of the Cyrenaican Bedouins, whose way of life had not changed much in the centuries since the Arabs had first accepted the Islamic prophet Mohammad's teachings.\n\nIn 1855 Senussi moved farther from direct Ottoman surveillance to Jaghbub, a small oasis some 30 miles northwest of Siwa. He died in 1860, leaving two sons, Mahommed Sherif (1844–95) and Mohammed al-Mahdi, who succeeded him.\n\nDevelopments since 1859\nSayyid Muhammad al-Mahdi bin Sayyid Muhammad as-Senussi (1845 – 30 May 1902) was fourteen when his father died, after which he was placed under the care of his father's friends Amran, Reefi and others.\n\nThe successors to the sultan of the Abu Qubays, Sultan Ali (1858–74) and the Sultan Yusef (1874–98), continued to support the Senussi. Under al-Mahdi the zawiyas of the order extended to Fez, Damascus, Constantinople and India. In the Hejaz members of the order were numerous. In most of these countries the Senussites wielded no more political power than other Muslim fraternities, but in the eastern Sahara and central Sudan things were different. Mohammed al-Mahdi had the authority of a sovereign in a vast but almost empty desert. The string of oases leading from Siwa to Kufra, and Borkou were cultivated by the Senussites and trade with Tripoli and Benghazi was encouraged.\n\nAlthough named 'al-Mahdi' by his father, Muhammad never claimed to be the actual Mahdi (Saviour), although he was regarded as such by some of his followers. When Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed himself the actual Mahdi in 1881, Muhammad Idris decided to have nothing to do with him. Although Muhammad Ahmed wrote twice asking him to become one of his four great caliphs (leaders), he received no reply. In 1890, the Ansar (forces of Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi) advancing from Darfur were stopped on the frontier of the Wadai Empire, Sultan Yusuf proving firm in his adherence to the Senussi teachings.\n\nMuhammed al-Mahdi's growing fame made the Ottoman regime uneasy and drew unwelcome attention. In most of Tripoli and Benghazi his authority was greater than that of the Ottoman governors. In 1889 the sheik was visited at Jaghbub by the pasha of Benghazi accompanied by Ottoman troops. This event showed the sheik the possibility of danger and led him to move his headquarters to Jof in the oases of Kufra in 1894, a place sufficiently remote to secure him from a sudden attack. However, the Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II clearly wanted to maintain positive relations because he sent his aide-de-camp Azmzade Sadik El Mueyyed to meet Sheikh Mohammed al-Mahdi al Senussi twice, once to Jaghbub in 1886 and once to Kufra in 1895. Azmzade Sadik El Mueyyed published his journals on these visits in his book titled Journey in the Grand Sahara of Africa in 1897.\n\nThe Senussi had Somali contacts in Berbera and consistently tried to rally Somalis to join their movement alongside their rival Mahdists. Sultan Nur Ahmed Aman of the Habr Yunis himself a learned Sheikh regularly received Senussi emissaries and housed them. Sultan Nur would go on to play a critical role in the subsequent Somali Dervish Movement starting in 1899.\n\nBy this time a new danger to Senussi territories had arisen from the French colonial empire, who were advancing from the French Congo towards the western and southern borders the Wadai Empire. The Senussi kept them from advancing north of Chad.\n\nLeadership of Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi\n\nIn 1902, Muhammad Idris died and was succeeded by his nephew, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, but his adherents in the deserts bordering Egypt maintained for years that Muhammad was not actually dead. The new head of the Senussi maintained the friendly relations of his predecessors with the Dud Murra of Wadai Sultan of the Wadai Empire, governing the order as regent for his young cousin, Muhammad Idris II (the future king Idris of Libya), who signed the 1917 Treaty of Acroma that ceded control of Libya from the Kingdom of Italy and was later recognized by them as Emir of Cyrenaica on October 25, 1920.\n\nThe Senussi, encouraged by the German and Ottoman Empires, played a minor part in the World War I, during the Senussi uprising, utilising guerrilla warfare against the Italian colonials in Libya and the British in Egypt from November 1915 until February 1917, led by Sayyid Ahmad, and in the Sudan from March to December 1916, led by Ali Dinar, the Sultan of Darfur. In 1916, the British sent an expeditionary force against them known as the Senussi Campaign led by Major General William Peyton. According to Wavell and McGuirk, Western Force was first led by General Wallace and later by General Hodgson.\n\nItaly took Libya from the Ottomans in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911. In 1922, Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini launched his infamous Riconquista of Libya — the Roman Empire having done the original conquering 2000 years before. The Senussi led the resistance and Italians closed Senussi khanqahs, arrested sheikhs, and confiscated mosques and their land. Libyans fought the Italians until 1943, with 250,000–300,000 of them dying in the process.\n\nIdris of Libya\nFrom 1917 to his death, in 1933, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi's leadership was mostly nominal. Idris of Libya, a grandson of Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi, the Grand Senussi, replaced Ahmed as effective leader of the Order in 1917 and went on to play a key role as the Senussi leader who brought the Libyan tribes together into a unified Libyan nation.\n\nIdris established a tacit alliance with the British, which led to two agreements with the Italian rulers, one of which brought most of inland Cyrenaica under the de facto control of the Senussis. The resulting Accord of al-Rajma, consolidated through further negotiations with the Italians, earned Idris the title of Emir of Cyrenaica, albeit new tensions which compromised that delicate balance emerged shortly after.\n\nSoon Cyrenaica became the stronghold of the Libyan and Senussi resistance to the Italian rulers. In 1922, Idris went into exile in Egypt, as the Italian response to the Libyan resistance grew increasingly violent.\n\nIn 1931 Idris married his first cousin Fatimah el-Sharif, a daughter of his predecessor Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Senussi tribes led by Idris formally allied themselves with the British Eighth Army in North Africa against the German and Italian forces. Ultimately, the Senussis proved decisive in the British defeat of both Italy and Germany in North Africa in 1943. As the Senussi were leading the resistance, the Italians closed Senussi khanqahs, arrested sheikhs, and confiscated mosques and their land. The Libyans fought the Italians until 1943, with some 250,000 of them dying in the process.\n\nAs historian Ali Abdullah Ahmida remarked, the Senussi order was able to transcend 'ethnic and local tribal identification', and therefore had a unifying influence on the Libyans fighting the Italian occupiers. A well-known hero of the Libyan resistance and an ally of Idris, Omar Mukhtar, was a prominent member of the Senussi order and a Sufi teacher whom the Italians executed in 1931.\n\nAfter the end of the war in 1945, the Western powers pushed for Idris, still leader of the Senussi order, to be the leader of a new unified Libya. When the country achieved independence under the aegis of the United Nations in 1951, Idris became its king, and Fatimah his Queen consort.\n\nAlthough it was instrumental in his accession to power, according to the Islamic scholar Mohammed Ayoob, Idris used Islam 'as a shield to counter pressures generated by the more progressive circles in North Africa, especially from Egypt.'\n\nOn September 1, 1969, a military coup led by Muammar Gaddafi marked the end of Idris’ reign. The king was toppled while he was receiving medical treatment in Turkey. From there he fled to Greece and then Egypt, where he died in exile in 1983. Meanwhile, a republic was proclaimed, and Idris was sentenced to death in absentia in November 1971 by the Libyan People's Court.\n\nIn August 1969, Idris issued a letter of abdication designating his nephew Hassan as-Senussi as his successor. The letter was to be effective on September 2, but the coup preceded Idris’ formal abdication. King Idris’ nephew and Crown Prince Hasan as-Senussi, who had been designated Regent when Idris left Libya to seek medical treatment in 1969, became the successor to the leadership of the Senussi order.\n\nMany Libyans continue to regard Idris with great affection, referring to him as the 'Sufi King'. In May 2013, Idris and Omar Mukhtar were commemorated for their role as Senussi leaders and key players in Libya's independence in a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the African Union in Addis Ababa.\n\nDevelopments since 1969\nGaddafi banned the Senussi order, forced the Senussi circles underground, and systematically persecuted prominent Senussi figures, in an effort to remove Sufi symbols and to silence voices of the Senussi tradition from Libya's public life. The remaining Senussi tribes were severely restricted in their actions by the revolutionary government, which also appointed a supervisor for their properties.\n \nIronically, Omar Mukhtar became one of Gaddafi's most inspiring figures, whose speeches he frequently quoted, and whose image he often exhibited in official occasions.\nIn 1984, Libya's distinguished Senussi University was closed by Gaddafi's order, although international scholars continued to visit the country until the beginning of the civil war to study the Senussi history and legacy. In fact, evidence of the Senussi presence and activism was recorded throughout the 1980s.\nVocal anti-Gaddafi resistance emerged among the former Senussi tribes in Cyrenaica in the 1990s, which Gaddafi violently suffocated with his troops. \nIn 1992, Crown Prince Hasan as-Senussi died. The leadership of the Senussi order passed to his second son, Mohammed el Senussi, whom Hasan had appointed as his successor to the throne of Libya.\n\nEnduring relevance of the Senussi Order\nThe Sufi heritage and spirit remains prominent today, and its sentiment and symbols have inspired many during the 2011 revolution. The image of Omar Mukhtar and his popular quote “We win or we die” resonated in Tripoli and in the country as Libyans rose up to oust Gaddafi. In July 2011 The Globe and Mail contributor Graeme Smith reported that one of the anti-Gaddafi brigades took the name of “Omar Mukhtar Brigade”.\n\nStephen Schwarz, executive director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism, reflected on the “Sufi foundation” of Libya's revolution in his August 2011 piece for the Huffington Post. Schwarz observed that Libya continued to stand “as one of the distinguished centers of a Sufism opposed both to unquestioning acceptance of Islamic law and to scriptural absolutism, and dedicated to freedom and progress.” “With the fall of the dictatorship,” he wrote, “it will now be necessary to analyze whether and how Libya’s Sufi past can positively influence its future.”\n\nIn August 2012, hardline Salafi extremists attacked and destroyed the shrine of al-Shaab al-Dahmani, a Sufi saint, in Tripoli. The tombs of Sufi scholars were systematically targeted by extremists as well.\n\nThe sustained attacks were consistently denounced by Sufi scholars as well as by the League of Libyan Ulema, a group of leading Libyan religious scholars, calling the population to protect the religious and historical sites “by force” and urging the authorities to intervene in order to avoid further escalations of violence and new attacks by Salafi groups.\n\nChiefs of the Senussi Order \n Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi (1843–1859)\n Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi (1859–1902)\n Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi (1902–1916; died 1933)\n Idris of Libya (1916–1969; died 1983)\n Hasan as-Senussi (1969–1992)\n Mohammed El Senussi (1992–present)\n\nSenussi family tree\n\nSee also\n\n Sufism\n List of Sufi orders\n Senussi Campaign in World War I\n Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi\n Idris bin Abdullah al-Senussi\n Ahmed al-Senussi\n Abdullah Senussi\n Omar Mukhtar\n Charles de Foucauld\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n Azmzade Sadik El Mueyyed, Journey in the Grand Sahara of Africa (1897), republished in Azmzade, Gokkent, Senusi et al. in Journey in the Grand Sahara of Africa and Through Time (2021)\n E.

It merged with the Maple Valley Conference for the 2008 season to form the Western Valley Activities Conference.\n\nFormer members\n\nHistory\nThe Boyer Valley Conference had been formed around 1960 and had many schools consolidate over the years. For much of its history, the Boyer Valley Conference consisted of members in West Harrison in Mondamin, Woodbine, Dunlap, Schleswig, Charter Oak, Dow City, Irwin, Logan, Ar-We-Va in Westside, and East Monona in Moorhead. In 1977, Manilla won the 1A State Football Championship. In the early 1980s, Manilla joined the league, followed by Manning a few years later. This put the league at 12 schools in the late 1980s. Schleswig won the Class A State Football Championship in 1984 and 1988.\n\nBy 1990, Dunlap was sharing sports with Dow City-Arion and Irwin-Kirkman was sharing with Manilla. Before long, these schools officially consolidated. They became known as Boyer Valley and IKM, respectively. In 1990, Logan-Magnolia won the Class A State Football Championship. More change was on the horizon for the league, though. Schleswig left the conference in 1993 to consolidate with Denison, who went on to join the Hawkeye Ten Conference. Then, East Monona closed its high school and the district was eventually dissolved by the state in 1998. In 2002, Manning won the Class A State Football Championship and in 2006 IKM won it. The League's seminal moment may have come in 2005 when Charter Oak-Ute defeated IKM for the 1A Girls Basketball Championship in Des Moines.\n\nThe league continued to operate until its final year of 2007 when the conference was left with only eight schools: Ar-We-Va, Boyer Valley, Charter Oak-Ute, IKM, Logan-Magnolia, Manning, West Harrison, and Woodbine. With IKM and Manning set to enter a sport-sharing agreement for the 2008–09 school year, it looked like the right time for many of its members to find a new home. The league consolidated with the Maple Valley Conference to form the Western Valley Activities Conference.\n\nLegacy\nThe Western Valley Activities Conference proved to be a poor fit for many member schools. In 2013, just five years after it began competition, all of the former Boyer Valley Conference members left the league for other conferences. The former Boyer Valley members now live on in one of two conferences. IKM-Manning and Logan-Magnolia now compete in the 10-team Western Iowa Conference. Ar-We-Va, Boyer Valley, Charter Oak-Ute, West Harrison, and Woodbine are founding members of the Rolling Valley Conference, which began play in 2013–14.\n\nReferences\n\nHigh school sports conferences and leagues in the United States\n2008 establishments in Iowa\n2013 disestablishments in Iowa\nDefunct sports leagues in the United States\nSports leagues established in 2008"},

The tournament's tag line is: 'Men and women. On the same course. At the same time. For equal prize money.' The men and women play on the same course at the same time in alternating groups.\n\nHistory\nThe first Victorian Open was played at Riversdale in 1957, replacing the Victorian Close Championship which had been first held in 1948. It was won by Ossie Pickworth who finished 10 strokes ahead of the field. Prize money was £250 but only one competitor, amateur Harry Hattersley, was from outside the state.\n\nThree of the first four editions were won by Victorians with Gary Player winning 1959. However professionals from New South Wales won 9 of the 10 events from 1961 to 1970 with only Peter Thomson from Victoria breaking their run of success in 1968.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007 the tournament was part of the second-tier Von Nida Tour.

In six years, the total prize pool has increased ten-fold. In 2019, the men's and women's Victorian Open fields played for a total purse of $3 million, $1.5 million for each event.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the event was co-sanctioned by the European Tour. The event continues to be played alongside the Women's Victorian Open, now co-sanctioned by the LPGA Tour. The event features a double cut, 65 players will remain after the first cut, then 35 players after the Saturday cut. In February 2019, James Nitties matched the world record of nine consecutive birdies in the Victorian Open. His birdie run from the 15th to the fifth in the first round set a European Tour record and matched Mark Calcavecchia's feat in the 2009 Canadian Open. David Law won the first co-sanctioned European Tour edition of the event. He won by a one stroke margin after entering the final three holes three strokes behind. Law birdied the 16th and eagled the final hole, this coupled with Wade Ormsby double bogeying his penultimate hole, led to Law claiming victory.\n\nNo event was played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Jones was selected by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He played college football at Syracuse. He is the younger brother of former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones and of former National Football League (NFL) player Arthur Jones.\n\nEarly years\nJones attended Union-Endicott High School, where he played high school football. He was a 2007 SuperPrep All-Northeast and PrepStar All-East Region selection. Jones was ranked as the eighth-best prospect of the state of New York by Scout.com.\n\nCollege career\nJones attended and played college football at Syracuse from 2008-2011. After not playing as a freshman in 2008, he appeared in 12 games as a sophomore. He totaled 52 combined tackles and 1.5 sacks. As a junior in 2010, he recorded 57 total tackles, four sacks, four passes defensed, and three forced fumbles. As a senior in 2011, Jones played in only seven games due to injury, but still was an All-Big East selection after recording 39 tackles and 4.5 sacks.\n\nOn December 30, 2011, Jones announced that he would enter the 2012 NFL Draft.\n\nCollegiate statistics\n\nProfessional career\n\nJones was considered one of the best defensive end prospects for the 2012 NFL Draft.\n\nNew England Patriots\n\n2012 season\nJones was drafted by the New England Patriots in the first round with the 21st overall selection. He was the highest selected player from Syracuse since defensive end Dwight Freeney in 2002. On May 23, 2012, Jones signed a four-year contract with the Patriots.\n\nAs a rookie, Jones was immediately thrust into the starting right defensive end slot for the Patriots in 2012. In Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans, Jones strip-sacked quarterback Jake Locker, with fellow rookie teammate Dont'a Hightower recovering the ball and returning it for a touchdown. A week later Jones sacked Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kevin Kolb, forcing a fumble that was recovered by the Patriots.\n\nIn Week 6 against the Seattle Seahawks, Jones recorded two sacks on quarterback Russell Wilson and managed to provide some good pressure on the Seahawks offensive line, forcing one fumble in that game. Jones made his sixth career sack in Week 8 against the St. Louis Rams by dropping Sam Bradford to the turf in London, England. In 14 games (13 starts) of his rookie season in 2012, Jones produced 45 tackles, 6 sacks, 5 passes defended, and 3 forced fumbles.\n\n2013 season\nIn a game against the Baltimore Ravens, quarterback Tyrod Taylor fumbled the snap and Jones recovered it in the end zone for the first touchdown of his career. Jones started all 16 games in 2013 recording 42 tackles with 11.5 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and a fumble recovery returned for a touchdown.\n\n2014 season\nFor the season, Jones recorded 43 tackles and 6 sacks in 10 games. In Week 2, Jones recorded 2 sacks; he also blocked a field goal and returned it for a touchdown.

Through the first eight games, Jones racked up 9.5 sacks, including two in an October 29 win over the Miami Dolphins on Thursday Night Football to help the Patriots move to 7-0. Jones would finish the regular season with a team-leading 12.5 sacks, a new career high, as well as his first career interception. He was ranked 48th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.\n\nSix days before the Patriots took on the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Divisional Playoffs, Jones was hospitalized after showing up at the Foxborough Public Safety Building in a disoriented but cooperative state. Later reports indicated that he had experienced a bad reaction to synthetic marijuana, a legal drug under Massachusetts law. Jones would still play in the following Divisional Playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs and the AFC Championship game against the Denver Broncos.\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\n2016 season\nOn March 15, 2016, Jones was traded to the Arizona Cardinals in exchange for Jonathan Cooper and a second-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. In 2016, Jones started all 16 games for the Cardinals, recording 49 tackles, 11 sacks, three passes defensed and four forced fumbles.

He finished the season with 49 tackles, 13 sacks, four passes defensed, and three forced fumbles. His 13 sacks led the team and were tied for seventh in the league.\n\n2019 season\nDuring Week 3 against the Carolina Panthers, Jones sacked Kyle Allen twice in the 38-20 loss. During a Week 7 27–21 road victory over the New York Giants, he sacked rookie Daniel Jones four times, one of which resulted in a forced fumble which he recovered. Jones was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Week for his performance. During Week 16 against the Seattle Seahawks, Jones sacked Russell Wilson four times and forced a fumble on David Moore which was recovered by teammate Jordan Hicks during the 27–13 road victory.\n\nJones finished the season with 53 tackles and set career-highs in sacks with 19, forced fumbles with eight, fumble recoveries with three, pass deflections with five.

They have been on public access television stations. The videos include common PCOS symptoms including infertility, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, anxiety, depression, and hirsutism.They are many other common symptoms as well besides the ones that was mention or showed in the show such as: thinning of hair, spot on the skin/ look and feel rough, acne and pelvis pain. The series is produced by William R. Patterson. and Sasha Ottey, president of PCOS Challenge, Inc.\n\nSasha Ottey, a microbiologist started PCOS Challenge after her PCOS diagnosis in 2008.\n\nVision \nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 1 in 10 women of childbearing age. It is commonly diagnosed by hormonal imbalance and metabolism problems that adversely impacts the health and physical appearance of women. If left undiagnosed and untreated, it can lead to infertility in extreme cases. However, lack of information and research regarding a disease that affects millions of women worldwide led to the formation of PCOS challenge. Their aim is to make PCOS a public health priority and bridge the information gap to aid successful treatment.\n\nSupport Resources \nPCOS Challenge, Inc. is a nonprofit organization serving 50,000 members  that provides support for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome through television and radio programming, educational workshops, and online and offline support networks.\n\nPCOS Challenge Radio Show \nIn a bid to spread greater awareness about PCOS and related conditions, Sasha Ottey (Founder and Executive Director of PCOS Challenge, Inc.) hosts a popular radio show - PCOS Challenge® radio show. The primary aim of the show is to interview experts, authors and feature rivetting stories from women who've endured the hardships that come along with living with PCOS.\n\nSeason one\nThe show follows ten women with PCOS who are coached by registered dietitian Rebecca Mohning, fitness trainer Josef Brandenburg, and clinical psychologist Ruth Wittersgreen. The women are also guided by alternative and traditional medical experts including reproductive endocrinologists, dermatologists, acupuncturists, and naturopathic physicians.\n\nFor nutrition, much of the focus was on eating a low-carbohydrate diet to help improve insulin sensitivity that seems to be at the root of many of the problems associated with PCOS. The women take fish oil and vitamin D to help improve their insulin sensitivity.\n\nIn addition to the low-carb diet, the fitness program they was focused on anaerobic exercise — specifically on resistance training and high-intensity interval training. The reason these modes of training were used is three-fold:\n\nSafety\nIn PCOS most women are obese. Endurance exercise, such as jogging, involving much repetitive stress. Each mile is 1,500 repetitions, and each impact is five times body weight. If body weight is an issue, pounding with repetitive endurance work is likely to cause an injury. The resistance training workouts on the show had no more than 15 consecutive repetitions of a movement before the contestant were allowed to rest. Often the initial phases of the resistance training workouts involved reducing the contestant's weight with some sort of external assistance, as their body weight was simply more than they could safely handle. \nInterval training (intervals of intense work with periods of rest and recovery) allowed the women's bodies to recover enough for the exercise to be safe and avoid injury.\n\nEfficacy\nResistance training and interval training are effective tools for increasing insulin sensitivity in those with insulin resistance. These forms of training depend mostly on anaerobic glycolysis which can deplete the body's stored carbohydrates and create a 36-hour window of increased insulin sensitivity to assist with weight loss and PCOS.\n\nTime efficiency\nMost of the women had a full-time job, and many were commuting from great distances to participate in the show, so time was a limiting factor for all of them. It seems that one can get the same or superior results from less time invested in exercise if one uses methods such as resistance training or high intensity interval training.\n\nEpisodes\nIn each episode, the women share their experiences living with polycystic ovary syndrome and learn ways to overcome their challenges with the condition.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official PCOS Challenge Television Show Website\n PCOS Challenge Nonprofit Organizational Website\n PCOS Challenge Support Network\n\n2010 American television series debuts\n2010s American reality television series\n2010s American documentary television series\n2020s American reality television series\n2020s American documentary television series"},

His uncle was Charles Campbell Worthington (1854–1944), who took over his grandfather's Worthington Corporation.  His grand-nephew through his brother Izard, was Thomas Newton Whiteside Rae (d. 2011).  His niece was Edwina Worthington Whitehouse, who married Gregory Van Sicklen McLoughlin, a painter, and committed suicide in 1923.\n\nHe was educated in New York, taking a class at St. John's School, and then abroad to complete his studies.  After graduation, he spent three years traveling, including in Africa.\n\nCareer\nAfter returning to the United States, he joined Edward Sweet & Co., bankers, working with them for three years.  His cousin Henry Worthington Bull (1874–1958), the son of his maternal aunt Sara Newton Worthington and her husband William Lauman Bull, also worked at Edward Sweet & Co.\n\nFollowing Edward Sweet & Co., he joined with Edward Ludlow Hall (1872–1932) in real estate ventures.  He later formed a partnership known as Mills & Whitehouse.  It was dissolved and he joined John N. Golding to form Golding & Whitehouse, later Whitehouse & Porter with Clarence Porter, the only surviving son of Gen. Horace Porter, the U.S. Ambassador to France.  After Porter's death, Whitehouse later founded his own real estate firm, Worthington Whitehouse Inc. in 1915, which rented and sold properties in New York, especially along Fifth Avenue and in Murray Hill, and in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nIn 1921, he stepped down as president of his firm, Worthington Whitehouse Company, Inc., and appointed Newton Rae, his relative who was a friend of Albert Eugene Gallatin, as president in his place.  In 1935, several years after his death, his firm was dissolved and its president, Newton Rae, and officers joined Douglas L. Elliman & Co.\n\nSociety life\nWhitehouse was a member of the infamous 'Four Hundred' of New York Society, as dictated by Mrs. Astor and Ward McAllister and published in The New York Times on February 16, 1892. He was known for being the master of the cotillion, along with Cathleen Neilson Vanderbilt, the wife of Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt.  In 1914, he accompanied Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, among others, to the opening of Verdi's Un ballo in maschera at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nHe was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, Racquet and Tennis Club, and was a member of the Delta Phi fraternity.\n\nWhitehouse, who did not marry, died on February 14, 1922 at his home, Worthington Farms in Elmsford, New York.\n\nReferences \nNotes\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1864 births\n1922 deaths\nPeople included in New York Society's Four Hundred\nWhitehouse family\nPeople from Irvington, New York\nPeople from Greenburgh, New York\nAmerican real estate brokers\nFordham University alumni"},

The first time he is imprisoned in the Bastille, from which he escapes using Masonic techniques of concentration to help distract himself from the pain involved in climbing down from his tower. The second time Sigismundo is imprisoned by a more mysterious group of captors, who seek to convince him that he is a descendant of Jesus Christ. In the third book, Sigismundo finds himself in further exile, in the wilderness of North America.\n\nKenneth Lamar Noid incident\n\nIn an interview Wilson did with James Wallis of ESTWeb, Wallis mentioned 'someone held up a fast-food restaurant demanding $100,000, a helicopter and a copy of The Widow's Son.'

He won three caps and scored one goal for the Sweden national team.\n\nCareer\nSteiner started out playing football in his homeland with IFK Norrköping. He moved to England in 1996, originally on loan to Bradford City when manager Chris Kamara signed Steiner, fellow Swede Magnus Pehrsson and Norwegian striker Ole Bjørn Sundgot. Steiner was the most successful of the three after scoring three league goals during his loan spell, and more famously one of the three goals in the 3–2 FA Cup triumph over Everton. Steiner's form earned him a call-up to the national side. He won three caps and scored one goal.\n\nKamara bought the Swede for £500,000 the following summer. In his first and only full season at Valley Parade he forged a deadly partnership with Brazilian Edinho. The pair each scored ten goals and were the club's leading goalscorers during 1997–98. The following summer new manager Paul Jewell was given cash to spend by chairman Geoffrey Richmond and Steiner fell out of favour. He played just one League Cup game in 1998–99 in a 1–1 draw with Lincoln City.\n\nSteiner was loaned out twice to Queens Park Rangers and once to Walsall before he was signed permanently by QPR for £215,000.

Seven of the 37 people on board died.\n\nAccident\nAngara Airlines flight IK9007 (reported also as flight SP5007) took off from Bogashevo Airport in Tomsk at 10:10 local time (UTC+7) on 11 July bound for Surgut International Airport, with 4 crew and 33 passengers on board.\n\nAt around 11:36, while the aircraft was cruising at , a magnetic chip detector signalled the presence of particles in the port (left) engine's oil system. The captain decided to continue the flight, but 8 minutes later a burning smell filled the cockpit and the fire alarm on the port engine briefly activated. The engine was throttled back but not shut down, and the bleed air supply was closed.\n\nThe crew initiated a diversion to Nizhnevartovsk Airport, and at 11:52, following a sudden drop in the oil pressure and the onset of severe vibrations, the crew realised that the engine was indeed on fire, at which point the engine was shut down and the  fire suppression system activated. However, the fire did not extinguish, and the crew elected to ditch immediately into the nearby Ob River.\n\nThe An-24 came down at 11:56 near Strezhevoy, approximately  south-east of Nizhnevartovsk. Due to the shallow water and the presence of undulations in the river bed, the aircraft was severely damaged in the ditching. Seven of the 37 people on board were killed. Nineteen people were treated for injuries.\n\nAircraft\nThe accident aircraft was an Antonov An-24RV with registration RA-47302. Manufactured in 1975, at the time of the accident it was 36 years old and had accumulated over 48,000 flight hours. It was powered by two Ivchenko AI-24 turboprop engines.\n\nInvestigation\n\nThe Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC/МАК) of the Commonwealth of Independent States opened an investigation into the accident. Both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder were recovered and examined.\n\nIn August 2011, the West Siberian Transportation Prosecution Office announced that maintenance of the aircraft was found to be not compliant with Russian regulations, and that maintenance checks for the magnetic chip detector were noted in the aircraft's technical log but were never carried out. Two officials of Angara Airlines were charged.\n\nIn December 2013, the MAK released its final report. It found that the engine fire had originated with the failure of a support bearing of the compressor rotor, possibly due to a manufacturing defect or an incorrect reassembly of the engine after maintenance. The report also cited as contributing factor the captain's apparent reluctance to shut down the affected engine despite various abnormal indications, which allowed the fire to develop and become inextinguishable.\n\nSee also\n US Airways Flight 1549\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Final accident report (Archived) – Interstate Aviation Committee \n \n\nAviation accidents and incidents in 2011\n2011 disasters in Russia\nAccidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-24\nAirliner accidents and incidents involving ditching\nAviation accidents and incidents in Russia\nAirliner accidents and incidents caused by in-flight fires\nJuly 2011 events in Russia"},

Newell Martin", "text": "Henry Newell Martin, FRS (1 July 1848 – 27 October 1896) was a British physiologist and vivisection activist.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born in Newry, County Down, the son of Henry Martin, a Congregational minister. He was educated at University College, London and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1870, took the Part I Natural Sciences in 1873, and graduated B.A. in 1874. At the University of London, where he had graduated B.Sc. in 1870, he went on to become M.B. in 1871, and D.Sc. in 1872. \n\nMartin worked as demonstrator to Michael Foster of Trinity College from 1870 to 1876; and was a Fellow of Christ's College for five years from 1874. Daniel Coit Gilman of Johns Hopkins University, on advice from Foster and Thomas Huxley, hired Martin in 1876 and set up the university's Biology Department around him. \n\nMartin was appointed to the university's first professorship of physiology, one of the first five full professors appointed to the Hopkins faculty. It was understood that he would be laying the foundation for a medical school: Johns Hopkins School of Medicine eventually opened in 1893.\n\nHaving delivered the Croonian Lecture in 1883 on 'The Direct Influence of Gradual Variations of Temperature upon the Rate of Beat of the Dog's Heart', Martin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1885. \n\nMartin's scientific career was curtailed around 1893, by alcoholism. He died on 27 October 1896 in Burley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire.\n\nWork\nMartin developed the first isolated mammalian heart lung preparation (described in 1881), which Ernest Henry Starling later used. He collaborated with George Nuttall, at Baltimore for a year around 1885. With the hiring of William Keith Brooks came the opening of the Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory. It conducted its work at stations from Beaufort, North Carolina, to the Bahamas, studying marine life and interdependencies between species.\n\nViews\nMartin represented and spread the views of the Cambridge school of physiology around Michael Foster, which took account in a basic way of the theory of evolution. He co-wrote A Course of Practical Instruction in Elementary Biology (1875) with Thomas Huxley, a leading proponent of evolution. It was based on Huxley's annual summer course, given since 1871, of laboratory teaching for future science teachers; and concentrated on a small number of types of plants and animals.\n\nBiology labs were under attack by those opposed to experiments on live animals, a procedure known as vivisection. Martin defended vivisection, stating  'Physiology is concerned with the phenomena going on in living things, and vital processes cannot be observed in dead bodies.'  He invited visitors to his lab to observe experiments.\n\nSelected publications\n \n\nIntroductory lecture, 23 October 1876.\n\n  \n\nVarious co-authors (including his wife for the 1st edition).10th edition online.\nQuoted by Fye.\nCollected articles.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1879, Martin married Hetty Cary, widow of Confederate General John Pegram.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n H.

Dedicated exclusively to the renewable energy sector, IRECs are hosted by alternate Governments every two years and convened by REN21.\nOne of the major accomplishments of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa, was the recognition that renewable energy is a critical component of sustainable development, energy security, climate change, and air quality. \n\nWorldwide enthusiasm for renewable energy has increased dramatically since WSSD.\n\nBonn \nThe Bonn Renewable Energy Conference in 2004 was the inaugural, government-hosted international conference on renewable energy. 154 countries attended the Bonn Conference, which produced 3 outcomes: \n A Political Declaration containing shared political goals for an increased role of renewable energies and reflecting a joint vision of a sustainable energy future that provides better and more equitable access to energy as well as increased energy efficiency. \n An International Action Program of voluntary commitments to goals, targets, and actions within their own spheres of responsibility from governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders.\n Policy Recommendations for Renewable Energies that can be of benefit to governments, international organizations, and stakeholders as they develop new approaches and political strategies and address the roles and responsibilities of key actors.\n\nBeijing \n\nThe 2005 conference was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing from 7-8 November 2005. The conference called the world to consider renewable energy alternatives in a time of high oil prices.\n\nWashington \n\nThe Washington International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC 2008) was held March 4-6, 2008.\n\nNew Delhi \n\nThe Delhi International Renewable Energy Conference (DIREC 2010) was held 27-29 October 2010, in New Delhi, India.\n\nAbu Dhabi \n\nThe 2013 conference was held in Abu Dhabi in January 2013. In the declaration for the Abu Dhabi Renewable Energy Conference(ADIREC 2013), ministers called for the world's shares of renewable energy to double by 2030 under the leadership of the International Renewable Energy Agency(IRENA).\n\nSouth Africa \n\nIn October 2015, South Africa became the sixth country, and the first in Africa, to host\nthe International Renewable Energy Conference (IREC). The South African\nInternational Renewable Energy Conference – SAIREC 2015 – provided a global\nplatform for government ministers, high-level decision makers, experts, specialists and\nthought leaders, as well as private sector players and civil society, to discuss and\nexchange their vision, experiences and solutions to accelerate the global scale-up of\nrenewable energy.\n\nFrom 4-7 October South Africa welcomed 3,600 delegates from more than 80 countries.\nThis international event comprised 24 conference sessions featuring more than 150\nspeakers, 41 side events, 35 technical site visits and 56 exhibitors, providing extensive\nopportunities for delegates to discuss, learn and network.\nSAIREC provided a platform to address energy security and access. Under the theme\nof RE-Energising Africa, SAIREC demonstrated why Africa is the business destination\nfor the renewables energy sector. It also provided Africa with a unique opportunity to\nshowcase its nascent yet promising renewable energy industry and gain experience\nfrom best practices as adopted in countries at the forefront of renewable energy\ndeployment.\nIn parallel REN21 launched the SADC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Status\nReport, which provides a comprehensive overview of the status of renewable energy\nand energy efficiency in the region. It covers the 15 SADC countries: Angola,\nBotswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,\nMauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic\nof Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The report is available for download on the REN21\nwebsite along with a series of infographics.\nSAIREC was co-hosted by South Africa’s Department of Energy together with the South\nAfrican National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI), under the leadership of the\nMinister of Energy, Honorable Ms Tina Joemat-Pettersson (MP), with REN21 and with\nthe final support of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment, GIZ. See the REN21 website for the conference report, full Declaration\ntext, and photos\n\nMexico City \n\nThe renewable energy community came together in Mexico City mid-September under\nthe banner of the International Renewable Energy Conference (IREC). The Mexico\n\nInternational Renewable Energy Conference (MEXIREC) was the 7th in this conference\nseries, continuing the tradition of convening government and non-state actors around\nthe development of renewable energy policy.\n\nMEXIREC’s agenda was designed to encourage a systems approach to energy where\nthe generation and use of renewable energy are analysed from an integrated and\nmultifaceted perspective. The conference demonstrated how this diversification is\noccurring, not only in Latin American and the Caribbean but elsewhere in the world.\n\nOver the course of two days, more than 1,600 delegates participated in talks and\npresentations that revolved around five thematic areas: Policy and Finance; Electricity\nSector and Infrastructure; Heating and Cooling/Transport; Energy Access/Local Value\nCreation; and Technology Innovations. The presence and active participation of young\nprofessionals and women was particularly encouraging. It ended with presentation and\nacceptance of the Conference Declaration.\n\nIn parallel a new report, Renewable Energy Tenders and Community [Em]power[ment]:\nLatin America and the Caribbean was launched. The bi-lingual report (English/Spanish)\nexamines both the rise of tendering and community power projects in the region and proposes an accession process to reconcile the tension between maximising economic\nreturns and social impact.\n\nMEXIREC was the leading event of the “Dialogues for the Future of Energy, Mexico\n2017” (DEMEX). It was held 11-13 September, 2017 at the Expo Santa Fe Convention\nCenter, Mexico City and co-organized by SENER and REN21 will the support of the\nGerman government. See the REN21 website for the conference report, full Declaration\ntext, photos and much more.\n\nSouth Korea \n\nIREC 2019 will be held in South Korea. Korea’s ambition to\nphase out nuclear and coal and to increase levels of renewable energy in its national\nenergy mix were key determining factors in its selection.

It was the second car developed by TVR during the Martin Lilley era of the automotive firm.\n\nThe car was made available in both a V8 and a V6 format, with a total of 174 cars built between the two available engine formats.\n\n\nTuscan V8\n\nIn early 1967, the first Tuscans were made, available with only the V8 engine. Recalling the performance potential of the Grantura-based Griffith, it was based on the Grantura/Vixen and was built in three different configurations between January 1967 and early 1971. The engine was a  Ford Windsor V8, similar to that available in early Ford Mustangs. The motor was equipped with a Ford 4-barrel carburetor, made 271 hp, and was capable of propelling the car to a top speed of 155 mph. Stopping power came from disc brakes in the front and the rear. Production of the V8 models dwindled after the release of the V6, and was discontinued altogether in 1970. In total, 73 cars were sold by TVR with a V8. Most of the Tuscan V8s were sold in the United States, with only the occasional vehicle being built with right-hand drive for the home market.\n\nIt was originally available in a short-wheelbase form with Vixen-style bodywork, looking very much like a Series IV Grantura 1800S aside from its prominent bonnet bulge. Approximately twenty-four were built. The SWB style was essentially identical to the V8-powered Griffith, which was discontinued in early 1967 as a result of the reputation it had gained for issues with build quality and reliability. The LWB car arrived a little later and used the same long-wheelbase chassis as the Vixen S2, and the same method of bolting the body to the chassis. About another two dozen of these LWB Tuscan V8s were built until production ended in 1969.\n\n1970 saw the introduction of the widebody Tuscan V8 (LWB SE), which featured a restyled body shell that gave a preview to the upcoming M-series body style. The widebody Tuscan was powered by the larger  version of the small block Ford V8, and, although estimates vary, it appears that approximately ten widebody cars were built between 1970 and 1971. The V8 SE also had wider, hooded taillights mounted at a reverse rake.\n\nTotal production:\nSWB: approximately 24\nLWB: approximately 24\nLWB SE: approximately 10\n\nTuscan V6\n\nIn mid-1969, to provide a car at an intermediate level of performance, TVR released the Tuscan V6. Equipped with a 2994 cc OHV Ford Essex V6 motor, which came from Ford's British division (also used in the Ford Zodiac Mk IV and Ford Capri). The brakes were changed from the V8 model, as only the front used discs, and the rear had drum brakes. The V6 model was also narrower, using the same bodyshell as the TVR Vixen but with provision of an access panel above the rear differential, and a round tubular frame chassis similar to the TVR Vixen but with some upgrades.  It did, however, receive the same Salisbury differential as the Tuscan V8. The 3.0 L V6 powerplant produced 138 hp, and 182 lb/ft of torque equipped with a twin choke synchronous Weber 40DFAV carburetor and the car was able to reach speeds of 125 mph. At the time it was offered for sale, the Essex V6 did not meet emissions requirements in the United States, so the Tuscan V6 was not exported there although at least one car was sent into the US masquerading as a TVR Vixen. Most of the cars produced were right-hand-drive, for the home market. There were a total of 101 V6 cars produced including a prototype before the line was stopped altogether to make way for its successor, the TVR Vixen 2500.\n\nSee also\nTVR Tuscan Challenge - introduced in 1988, this was a competition-only roadster built in small numbers\nTVR Tuscan Speed Six - Recent model (produced from 1999-2006) that bears the same name.\n\nReferences\n\nSports cars\nCars introduced in 1967\n1970s cars"},
{"id": "69086537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laron%20Williams", "title": "Laron Williams", "text": "Laron Ronald Williams (1949 – July 7, 1985) was an American serial killer. Originally convicted in the 1977 murder of a prostitute in Nashville, Tennessee and suspected in at least two similar killings, Williams later escaped from prison and murdered a police officer and a priest within days of one another in 1981. He was separately sentenced to death for both murders, but was killed by fellow inmates on death row in 1985 before he could be executed.\n\nEarly life\nMuch of Williams' early life is shrouded in mystery. During an interview on death row, he said that he was born somewhere outside of the United States in 1949, the second of six children of a father serving in the Army. Williams claimed that he saw little of his father when he was little, as he  was serving in Korea, but after the war ended, he returned and the family moved to Louisiana. Williams told that he entered high school in a town called 'Newardton', a presumably fictitious location as no records of such a place existing in the state have been located, before moving to Southern California. While there, he finished high school and supposedly spent a year and a half in college studying psychology, but again, he refused to disclose the exact location. During the 1970s, he drifted around various parts of the country before permanently settling in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nMurders\n\nTerra Wedlaw\nCirca August or early October 1977, Williams went to stay at a friend's apartment at the Pagoda Garden Apartments in Nashville. On October 18, he solicited the services of a 19-year-old prostitute, Terra Wedlaw, who had arrived in the city just two months earlier from Tampa, Florida. The pair went to the Capitol Park Inn to have sex, but after they had finished, Williams strangled her and fled the premises. Just a few weeks later, he was arrested on murder charges by local authorities, after the woman's birth certificate was found in his possession. While he awaited his trial, it was publicly announced that Williams was a suspect in two similar murders that had occurred in Nashville: the strangulation murders of prostitute Mary Jo Corn (alias Larisa Ann Marsay) and bank teller Bessie Wallace, both 24. Both women were found nude and strangled in areas near the city, their hands and feet tied with rope, and each was killed months within one another. As the killings were similar to that of Wedlaw, authorities suspected that Williams was their killer, and he was also under investigation for other similar murders in places such as Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia; Portland, Oregon; Washington and his residence in Chicago.\n\nWhile awaiting trial at the Metro Jail, Williams was attacked by other inmates, receiving slight injuries for which he had to be treated at a hospital. To avoid further incidents, he was temporarily transferred to a jail outside the county, while authorities worked on gathering evidence to charge him with the three strangulations. In the end, he was only charged in Wedlaw's death, and in January 1979, on the advice of his lawyer, he pleaded guilty and received 10 years imprisonment, with a chance of parole after serving at least 4 years of the sentence. After his conviction, Williams was sent to the Fort Pillow State Prison, before being transferred to the Memphis Correctional Center in 1980. He was initially placed in a work release program to train as an electrical apprentice, but was soon removed due to his violent outbursts.\n\nEscape, further murders and recapture\nOn April 22, 1981, Williams climbed over the facility's fence and fled into town. He remained under the radar until May 12, when he was approached by 53-year-old police lieutenant Clarence P. Cox, who attempted to arrest him. In the ensuing scuffle, Williams managed to snatch the lieutenant's gun from his holster and shot him in the head, killing him on the spot. After Cox's body was found on the next day, state authorities made a priority to capture the dangerous fugitive. Just two days later, Williams went to Jackson and burgled into the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, where he fatally shot the 35-year-old assistant pastor, Rev. John Jay Jackson. Three days later, he was finally captured by authorities at a restaurant next to a motel where he was staying.\n\nTrial, imprisonment and death\nFollowing his arrest, Williams was separately charged with first-degree murder relating to the deaths of Cox and Jackson, each of which carried a possible death sentence. At the subsequent two trials, he was found guilty and sentenced to die in the electric chair. His initial execution dates were set for March 15 and July 14 of that year, but were delayed by automatic appeals to the Tennessee Supreme Court. During this time, Williams gave an interview to reporter Charles Thornton of the Memphis Press-Scimitar, where he discussed his case and reasserted his innocence, professing his belief that his convictions would be quashed and he would a free man after serving 1-to-5 years for the prison escape.\n\nOn July 8, 1985, during an exercise period at the Tennessee State Prison, Williams was attacked by a group of fellow death row inmates who proceeded to beat him with their fists and exercise weights. While the fight was quickly broken up, Williams was heavily injured and had to be driven to the nearby hospital, where he subsequently succumbed to his injuries. In the aftermath of the incident, prison authorities determined that the inmates' motive was the fact that Williams had been spending too much time on the prison telephone, which angered them significantly.\n\nTwo inmates, Cecil Johnson and Tony Bobo, were convicted of voluntary manslaughter for killing Williams. Both of them received 8-year sentences. Johnson was executed for the triple murder which originally sent him to death row on December 2, 2009. Bobo's death sentence was later reduced to life in prison on appeal. However, he was sentenced to life without parole for crimes committed during a prison escape in 1998.\n\nSee also\n List of serial killers in the United States\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\n1949 births\n1985 deaths\n20th-century American criminals\nAmerican male criminals\nAmerican serial killers\nMale serial killers\nAmerican people convicted of murder\nAmerican people convicted of murdering police officers\nPeople convicted of murder by Tennessee\nPrisoners sentenced to death by Tennessee\nAmerican prisoners sentenced to death\nSerial killers murdered in prison custody\nDeaths by beating in the United States\nPeople murdered in Tennessee\nPrison escapes\nFugitives wanted on murder charges\nFugitives wanted by the United States"},

In the late 1660s, there were thus three troops in England, one in Ireland, and two in Scotland of which one was ceremonial for attendance of Lord High Commissioner (named after John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton and after John Leslie, 7th Earl of Rothes). In 1707, there were four troops of Horse Guards (the three original English and one Scots), and two troops of Horse Grenadiers.\n\nFrom 1658 to 1788, the Horse Guards existed as independent troops.  They were placed on the English establishment in 1661, with the founding of the modern Regular British Army. In 1788, as part of the re-organisation of the British Army, the remaining 1st and 2nd Troops were united with the 1st and 2nd Troops of Horse Grenadier Guards to form, respectively, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Life Guards.\n\nOriginally, as befitted their role as bodyguards to the Sovereign, the ranks of these Troops were filled by members of the gentry. They, therefore, had no non-commissioned officers, their brigadiers (i.e. corporals) being commissioned and ranking as lieutenants, their sub-brigadiers (i.e. sub-corporals) ranking with cornets in the rest of the army.\nAlthough this no longer obtains, the non-commissioned officers of their successor regiment, the Life Guards, are still grades of Corporal, rather than sergeants.\n\n1st Troop [1658-1788]\n\n1658-1788 1st (His Majesty's Own) Troop of Horse Guards [formed in exile in Holland from followers of Charles II].\n1746 absorbed 3rd Troop, The Horse Guards.\n1788 absorbed 1st Troop, The Horse Grenadier Guards and was reorganised to form the 1st Regiment of Life Guards\n\n2nd Troop [1659-1788]\n\n1659 [raised as a Parliamentary life guard for attending the Council of State].\n Nov 1659 re-modelled as Monck's Life Guards\n1660-1661 3rd (The Duke of Albemarle's) Troop of Horse Guards.\n1661-1670 3rd (The Lord General's) Troop of Horse Guards.\n1670-1788 2nd (The Queen's) Troop of Horse Guards.\n1788 absorbed 4th Troop, The Horse Guards.\n1788 On 8 June it absorbs the 2nd Troop, The Horse Grenadier Guards, and on 25 June it is reorganised to form the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards.\n\n3rd Troop [1658-1746]\n\n1658-1670 2nd (The Duke of York's) Troop of Horse Guards [formed in exile in Holland from followers of Charles II]\n1670-1746 3rd (The Duke of York's) Troop of Horse Guards\n1746 absorbed by 1st Troop, The Horse Guards.\n\nScots and 4th Troop\n\n4th Troop [1686-1689] \n1686-1689 4th (Lord Dover's) Troop of Horse Guards [Disbanded upon the deposing of James II of England ].\n\n4th (Dutch) Troop [1689-1699] \n1599 raised on 30 April in Holland as a troop of horse and redesignated in 1665 as Garde du Corps van Zijne Majesteit, i.e., His Majesties Life Guards.\n1689-1699 Placed on English establishment in 1689 and returned to Dutch service in 1699 upon conclusion of the Nine Years' War and the Treaty of Ryswick. During this period the Dutch troop was ranked as the 4th Troop of Life Guards.

{"id": "50515450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob%20Rutstein", "title": "Jacob Rutstein", "text": "Jacob Rutstein (1877–1946) was an American businessman, philanthropist, real estate developer and lumber magnate who became known for his innovations to the Lumber Nominal Measurements or Nominal Size by the invention of the 11/4 wooden panel, commonly known as Jew Plank.\n\nEarly life\n\nJacob Rutstein was born in Tolochin, Belarus as Yankev Rutstein. From an early age, Jacob's father took him to the Tolochin commodities market which dealt primarily in lumber. Jacob developed a keen business acumen, and by the age of twelve, he far exceeded his own father's business prowess. During his teenage years, Rutstein was drafted into the Russian army after which he was recruited by a German company supervising the import of lumber into Western Europe.  At eighteen, Rutstein was promoted to the General Manager of the Minsk Capital Region. Over time, Rutstein amassed a small fortune which he subsequently deposited in London.  In 1902, at the age of approximately twenty-five, Rutstein, fleeing religious persecution,  immigrated to the United States via London. Unable to bring his assets from Europe into the United States, he settled in the Lower East Side of Manhattan bereft of his former fortune.\n\nDevelopment of Brownsville, Brooklyn\n\nBy 1909, Rutstein had migrated from the Lower East Side, where he had been working in a sweatshop for $3 a week, to Brownsville, Brooklyn, where he gained entry into the real estate industry. At the time, Brownsville, located in Eastern Brooklyn was a growing residential neighborhood with a large demand for modern housing.  By 1912, Rutstein founded Brownsville Housewrecking Company which facilitated building demolition and from which he salvaged and sold used lumber.  At the same time, Rutstein began acquiring land throughout Brooklyn - from Brownsville, Brooklyn to what would become Shore Road along the Belt Parkway. Rutstein's success in the wrecking and lumber businesses evolved into the formation, in 1922, of Brownsville Lumber.  As Principal of Brownsville Lumber, Rutstein supplied lumber to New York's leading real estate families and began to experiment with doing his own building and development.\n\nThe increased demand for lumber led Rutstein to acquire the raw source of timber.  During the 1920s, Rutstein began to acquire lumber fields throughout the United States and as far away as Oregon. By owning the source of lumber, Rutstein was able to sell cheap lumber at reduced rates and undercut his competition throughout New York City. In control of the lumber supply, Rutstein was able to undertake large building campaigns throughout Brooklyn and especially in Brownsville, Brooklyn and Crown Heights. The New York Times described Rutstein as 'a pioneer builder in the Brownsville-East New York section of Brooklyn.'\n\nPrudential Lumber Corporation & The Nominal Measurement Revolution\n\nIn 1930, in the midst of the depression, Rutstein formed the Prudential Lumber Corporation.  Despite the collapse of the global economy as a result of the depression, demand for cheaper lumber increased not only in New York but nationally.  Since 1918, Rutstein had been experimenting with cutting lumber logs along new nominal lumber measurements.  Rutstein innovated an 11/4' (2 3/4') wooden plank whereby the price of lumber was reduced 1/12 or about eight percent.  At the time, most floor beams were 3/10 x 8/4 and when dressed on four sides by going through a planer, the 8' or 10' wood would end up being 7 5/8' or 9 5/8' in width. Rutstein, who was influential over large lumber fields and mills, was able to convince others in the industry to instead cut the beams 2 3/4' (11/4') thick, 1/4' less, thereby increasing efficiency by eight percent.\n\nBy 1930, Rutstien was able to convince mills on the West Coast to adopt the standard and it was colloquially called  the 'Jew Plank'. According to Jim Denison in his history of the lumber industry, Rutstein 'wanted this low-grade lumber to use for shoring for five stories of basement for parking lots, and a lot of those skyscrapers. So [people in the industry] called this Jew Plank that they cut, and it was a three-inch thickness, a rough cut, and put on ships. There were Calmar Lines that came into Newport, from the Suez Canal route, getting out to the West Coast. They brought steel out from the East Coast and delivered steel, and took lumber back to the East Coast again.' This innovation would change the lumber industry and permanently adjust the structure of lumber nominal measurements into modern times. It also made Rutstein millions.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nRutstein's innovations to the nominal lumber size made him known in the lumber industry but it was his philanthropy for which he would be remembered. Rutstein was one of founders of Beth-El Hospital, Mesivta Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Brown Heights Yeshiva, United Lubavitcher Yeshiva, and a Director at Brooklyn Home of the Aged, Home for Incurables, Pride of Judea Orphans Home, Crown Heights Yeshiva, Jewish Theological Seminary, Brooklyn Jewish Center, Stone Ave. Talmud Torah.  He was also a founder and member of Temple Petach Tikvah for more than 30 years and a charitable contributor to most of the Yeshivas in U.S., the Holy Land, and other countries.\n\nBeth-El Hospital\nRutstein was a Principal Founder of Beth El Hospital (today Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center) and its predecessor, East New York Hospital. On Sunday, July 19, 1925, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that for 'the first time in Brownsville community work, $60,000 has been raised by 20 men especially for Brownsville and East New York Hospital to be used for the Nurses Home and Training School.' The article reports that the Chairman of the Building Committee, Jacob Rutstein, donated $5,000. On July 13, 1927, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported that opened a nurses training school. The article states, 'Jacob Rutstein, chairman of the building committee, announced a $90,000 deficit was borne by the directors.' The article continues that a 'gold key to the building was auctioned to Jacob Rutstein for $7,000.'\n\nOn February 23, 1933, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle announced that Jacob Rutstein was named for a committee at Beth-El Hospital, formally known as Brownsville and East New York Hospital. On November 12, 1933, an article appeared which contained a picture of Jacob Rutstein, the caption providing: 'Jacob Rutstein, prominent charitable worker and treasurer of the Beth-El Hospital, is active in obtaining subscriptions reservations for the hospital's 10th annual dinner to be held at the Waldorf Astoria held on Sunday evening. December 3. This annual dinner attracts an attendance of 1,200 and the proceeds go to the annual deficit.' Similar articles appeared on November 23, 1933, and December 13, 1934. On December 15, 1934, another article described the opening of the Beth-El Hospital bazar, and stated that Jacob Rutstein was chairman of the bazar committee and had help procure $50,000 worth of merchandise, which would go towards the deficit of the hospital. A similar article regarding Beth-El appeared on November 1, 1937. Another article about an upcoming Beth-El hospital dinner was published on May 5, 1940, citing Jacob Rutstein and stating that Samuel Strausberg, acting president of the hospital, praised Rutstein for his 'untiring efforts in helping to make the dinner a huge success.' Strausberg added that from 'early morning until late at night, Mr. Rutstein and his committee are giving up their own businesses in an effort to obtain subscriptions for the dinner.'\n\nYeshiva Chaim Berlin\n\nAn article in the Brooklyn Eagle, on March 16, 1942, describes one of the many donations he acquired for \nYeshiva Chaim Berlin, stating that '$2,000 was raised in outside gifts by Jacob Rutstein who recently returned from Florida.' On December 11, 1944, another article appeared in the Brooklyn Eagle, saying 'Yesivah Rabbi Chaim Berlin, one of the largest Orthodox Jewish institutions of learning in the country, is dedicating its new seven-story building at Stone and Pitkin Ave. at ceremonies which will take place throughout the week.  The opening ceremonies were attended by more than 3000 persons.  Jacob Rutstein, chairman of the dedication committee, announced that $25,000 had been donated by those present towards the new $1,000,000 building.'\n\nOn December 29, 1944, another article appeared stating the following about Rutstein:\n\n'Our congratulations to Jacob Rutstein for his constant activity on organizing activities for the advancement of orthodox Jewish secular and religious education.  Outstanding in his philanthropic activities is his recent purchase of the seven-story $1,000,000 building at 350 Stone Ave. for the Mesivtah and Yeshivah Rabbi Chaim Berlin in the heart of Brownsville.  Already the institution has been recognized by the State Board of Regents through the granting of a charter and 800 students are now enrolled. Of this number 150 are studying for the rabbinate. Also 200 of its students have come from all parts of this country and 62 are refugees driven from their homelands by Hitler. This has been a truly humanitarian endeavor on the part of Mr. Rutstein.'\n\nLubavitch\n\nRutstein played a role in bringing Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the sixth Lubavitcher rebbe, to the United States. Schneersohn, who was fleeing Nazi persecution, needed refuge in the United States. Rutstein worked with other leaders of the Jewish community to help bring Rabbi Schneersohn to the United States.  Once in the United States, Rutstein is reported to have assisted Rabbi Schneersohn in launching Lubavitch in America.  In addition to being a founder of the United Lubavitch Yeshivas,  Rutstien helped Lubavitch locate and purchase the building which would become its headquarters on 770 Eastern Parkway.  A picture of Rutstein hung in the Lubavitcher headquarters until the first half of the 1950s. Jacob's son, Nathan Rothstein, a real estate attorney, represented Lubavitch and did the closing of legal documents on the building.\n\nThe Redstone Group\nRutstein had numerous children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, many of whom continued in the real estate industry. Over four generations, the family included restaurateurs, developers, real estate attorneys and financiers. The multi-generational level of experience of the Rutstein family in the real estate sector ultimately evolved into The Redstone Group, a closely held family company in the real estate industry.\n\nNotable Descendants\nSome notable descendants of Jacob Rutstein include:\n\nHelaine Blumenfeld, artist\nRemy Blumenfeld, British TV producer\nJared Blumenfeld, former United States EPA regional administrator for the Pacific Southwest\nIsaiah Rothstein, American rabbi and activist\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n The Redstone Group https://web.archive.org/web/20160617122038/https://www.goredstone.com/\nhttp://www.jewishgen.org/belarus/newsletters/belarus/TolochinTrip/index.html\n\n1877 births\n1946 deaths\nAmerican people of Belarusian-Jewish descent\nAmerican real estate businesspeople\nBusinesspeople from New York City\nJewish American philanthropists\nPeople from Brownsville, Brooklyn\nPhilanthropists from New York (state)"},

{"id": "1855828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian%20Rules%20%28film%29", "title": "Australian Rules (film)", "text": "Australian Rules, is a 2002 Australian sports drama film directed by Paul Goldman and starring Nathan Phillips, Luke Carroll, Tom Budge, Brian Torry and Lisa Flanagan. The film was adapted from the novels Deadly, Unna? (1998) and Nukkin Ya by Phillip Gwynne. The film is about a young man experiencing the hardships of growing up in rural South Australia. In particular, it deals with the issue of racial relationships through the central characters, their involvement in local Australian rules football, and Aboriginal players. The film was launched at the Adelaide Festival of Arts on 5 March 2002, and nationwide on 29 August 2002.\n\nPlot\nIn the isolated and fictional South Australian fishing town of Prospect Bay, the only thing that connects the black and white communities is football. Gary 'Blacky' Black (Nathan Phillips) and Dumby Red (Luke Carroll) are an exception; teenage best friends from different sides of the tracks. Dumby is the star of the football team and likely to become the next big Aboriginal star in the big leagues. Gary is the bookish son of hard-drinking and brutal fisherman Bob Black (Simon Westaway). He is attracted to Dumby's sister, Clarence (Lisa Flanagan). Blacky's supportive mother helps him become a better player as he is chosen to be the ruckman in the team's upcoming grand final. Blacky has to overcome Thumper, the star player for the opposition. When gameday arrives Blacky at first struggles to make an impact on the game but Dumby inspires the team kicking several goals. When Dumby gets a mark near goals with the scores tied he hands it off to a teammate instead of taking the shot. The player kicks a point and Blacky has to run into Thumper to stop him from kicking the winning goal. Their team wins the premiership, but Dumby and Blacky's elation is short-lived. Dumby is passed over for the best-on-ground medal for the coach's son Simon Robertson. Dumby is disgusted and angered by the obvious racially motivated decision.\n\nDisgruntled, Dumby and his cousin Pretty (Tony Briggs) attempt to rob the bar where the celebrations were held, hoping to find the best-on-ground medal. After breaking into the bar, they meet the drunk owner, beat him into unconsciousness and proceed to the safe with the key found in his pocket. Bob, waking to find the owner unconscious with a head wound, heads to the office and loads a double-barrelled shotgun. Bob sneaks up behind Dumby and fires a shot into the figure in the darkness. Bob discovers he has killed Dumby. Pretty, who has been hiding behind the door, jumps him and points the gun at his neck. Pretty reveals himself by removing his makeshift balaclava. He does not shoot Bob but fires the remaining round into the ceiling and runs away into the darkness. Bob is questioned by police over the shooting but is let off on the grounds of self-defense. Blacky is devastated over Dumby's death and angrily tosses his premiership trophy into the ocean. Clarence and Blacky console each other and fall in love. Bob and the family are greeted with hostility and harassed by some local Aboriginal people which only further fuels Bob's violent temper and bigotry.\n\nClarence sneaks into Blacky's room one night and they make love. The next morning Bob discovers them in bed and beats Blacky. He racially insults Clarence and throws her out. Fed up with his father, Blacky leaves. Blacky meets with Dumby's family and attends his funeral. He acquires the best on ground medal and places it in Dumby's casket. After returning home he is confronted by Bob and is told he is no longer welcome in his house due to his relationship with Clarence. Blacky defiantly stands still even after Bob punches him repeatedly. Defeated and exhausted, Bob leaves the family never to come back. The football team is disbanded as no Aboriginal players show up to training or games. The film ends with Blacky and Clarence jumping into the lake and swimming in the water. Blacky narrates that they will both be leaving soon, as there is nothing left for them in this town.\n\nCast\n Nathan Phillips as Gary 'Blacky' Black\n Simon Westaway as Bob Black\n Celia Ireland as Liz Black\n Harrison Gilbertson as Greggy\n Kelton Pell as Tommy Red\n Luke Carroll as Dumby Red\n Tony Briggs as Pretty Red\n Lisa Flanagan as Clarence Red\n Tom Budge as Pickles\n Kevin Harrington as Mr. Robertson 'Arks'\n Martin Vaughan as Darcy\n\nAccolades\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \nAustralian Rules at Oz Movies\n \n \n Australian Rules at the National Film and Sound Archive\n\n2002 films\nARIA Award-winning albums\nAustralian films\n2002 directorial debut films\n2000s sports drama films\nAustralian sports drama films\nFilms shot in Adelaide\nFilms shot in South Australia\nAustralian rules football films\nFilms based on Australian novels\nFilms about race and ethnicity\nFilms about interracial romance\nFilms set in South Australia\n2002 drama films\n2000s English-language films"},

{"id": "11442638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer%20paper", "title": "Transfer paper", "text": "Transfer paper is used in textiles and arts and crafts projects. Transfer paper is a thin piece of paper coated with wax and pigment. Often, an ink-jet or other printer is used to print the image on the transfer paper.  A heat press can transfer the image onto clothing, canvas, or other surface. Transfer paper is used in creating iron-ons.\n\nInkjet \nMost conventional inkjet printers are not capable of printing white (though many wide format and direct-to-garment inkjet printers offer white ink as an option). So on these devices, in any white areas, the garment's existing colour shows through. The mirror of the image is printed on the paper. When it is transferred, the result is the mirror of the mirror (the original) results. Inkjet transfer paper for dark garments is covered with transferable white ink. For dark garments, the image is printed without mirroring.\n\nWashability for inkjet transfer paper is not as good as for screen-printed items.\n\nDye sublimation \n\nFor dye sublimation transfer paper, fabrics historically had to be white or light in color. 100% polyester, poly/cotton mix (the garment should be at least 50% poly) microfibre and nylon can all be used. This printing process turns solid ink into a gas, avoiding a liquid stage. This process can be used on ceramic, wood, glass, or metal as long as they have a polymer coating.\n\nTransfer papers now exist for most textiles, including elastic fabrics used for making sportswear and swimming suits, and for natural fiber fabrics such as cotton, silk, linen, and wool.\n\nColour laser \nColour laser transfer is very similar to the inkjet transfer paper process and allows the decoration of any combination of fabric blends including 50/50 poly/cotton blends as well as 100% cotton textiles. This type of transfer paper is used for industrial printing jobs on a large scale offering better quality paper and image transfer.\n\nHistory \n'The initial intent for this method of moving a pre- made image from one location to another was to serve as an essential substitute for ink. In 1801, Pellegrino Turri, an Italian inventor, invented carbon paper to provide the ink for his mechanical typing machine, one of the first typewriters.' Ralph Wedgwood obtained the first patent for carbon paper in 1806. Wedgwood's technique was then continuously perfected.\n\nSee also \n Carbon paper\n\nReferences \n\nPaper products\nCoated paper"},

He played for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2009 through 2011. Joaquín throws three pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a changeup.\n\nSigned by the Giants in 2003, Joaquín reached the major leagues in 2009 and appeared in 10 games, which would be his highest total in an MLB season. Part of the Opening Day roster in 2010, he pitched in four games during San Francisco's World Series championship season.

The fastball travels  to  and travels quickly to the upper inside corner of the strike zone for right-handed batters. Left-handed batters can see it more easily. The slider travels in the middle  range. Sam Corun of Bleacher Report mentioned in 2010 that his changeup needed to be better in order for him to walk fewer hitters.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1986 births\nLiving people\nAcereros de Monclova players\nArizona League Giants players\nAugusta GreenJackets players\nConnecticut Defenders players\nDominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Mexico\nDominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States\nFresno Grizzlies players\nGigantes del Cibao players\n\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nMajor League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic\nMexican League baseball pitchers\nSalem-Keizer Volcanoes players\nSan Francisco Giants players\nSan Jose Giants players\nSultanes de Monterrey players\nRieleros de Aguascalientes players\nWaikiki Beach Boys players\nEstrellas Orientales players\nSaraperos de Saltillo players\nVaqueros Laguna players\nCaribes de Anzoátegui players\nErie SeaWolves players\nLakeland Flying Tigers players\nYork Revolution players\nToros del Este players\nDominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Venezuela"},

{"id": "51273044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0zmir%20Commodity%20Exchange", "title": "İzmir Commodity Exchange", "text": "İzmir Commodity Exchange (ICE) is a commodities exchange based in İzmir, Turkey.  It was the first commodities exchange established in Turkey and focuses on agricultural products.  It functions in accordance with the Turkish Law No. 5174 regarding the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey and the Chambers and Commodity Exchanges.\n\nHistory\nThe İzmir Commodity Exchange was established in İzmir, the 3rd largest province of Turkey, in 1891 as the first commodity exchange of Turkey.\n\nİzmir has always been an important hub for agricultural production and one of the centers for domestic and foreign trade throughout the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Turkey. In fact, İzmir harbour was the most important export harbour of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, which made the city the host for the first efforts to systemize the agricultural markets and the first commodity exchange of Turkey.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the boost in the volume of the trade in İzmir urged the merchants to seek for new methods and regulations in order to catch up with novelties. Although new warehouses had been built to store the goods, unbalanced price adjustments, lack of proper statistics to determine demand and supply, and uncertainty of the money markets used to negatively affect the commercial life of the city. These problems caused the tradesmen and producers to suffer great losses. The tradesmen of İzmir commenced to make several attempts to overcome these problems. The Commercial Assembly and İzmir Chamber of Commerce were established in 1850 and 1885, respectively. The English, French, Italians and the Dutch had their own chambers of commerce in İzmir. However, these attempts had fallen behind in creating solutions to the problems of the market.\n\nAlthough the first legal arrangements in the Ottoman Empire were carried out in 1886, it is known that some attempts were made before this date to establish a commodity exchange in İzmir. It is also known that the building belonging to a tradesman called Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi was used as “the grain exchange” just before the 1890s. The arguments to establish a modern commodity exchange based on a legal status and conforming to certain rules were brought forward in the early 1890s. In 1891, two different commodity exchanges were attempted to be established by two different tradesmen, however, the General Commodity Exchange regulations specified only one commodity exchange in each city. Therefore, upon the inspections by the Ministry of Public Works, Nişli Hacı Ali Efendi's Commodity Exchange was declared as the sole legal exchange in the city and it was inaugurated with a ceremony on Monday, 13 June 1892.\n\nThe first elections were held at the end of that year and the first board of directors was formed. The regulations came into effect on 21 January 1895. The products traded at the Exchange in 1897 were barley, wheat, refined flour, semolina, bran, rye, flour, corn, maize, chickpea, dry beans, black-eyed pea, hemp seed, vetch, aniseed, dent corn, sesame, broad bean, poppy seed, olive oil, cotton, cotton seed and opium poppy. The public was informed daily of the transactions and prices through the local newspapers, which made monitoring supply and demand volume of the market possible.\n\nAs the economic life was severely damaged and agricultural production decreased during the World War I and Turkish Independence War, İzmir Commodity Exchange experienced rough times. Following the independence of Turkey and declaration of the republic, the present building of the İzmir Commodity Exchange was built and opened with a ceremony on 11 June 1928.\n\nSince then, İzmir Commodity Exchange has been serving its members and the society in general in the same building, the Exchange Palace, located at Gazi Boulevard No:2, Konak/İzmir.\n\nAffiliates, subsidiaries and joint ventures of the ICE\n Aegean Agricultural Products Licensed Warehouse Inc.

It was named because of its resemblance to the green color of a French liqueur called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764. Similarly, chartreuse yellow is a yellow color mixed with a small amount of green; it was named because of its resemblance to the color of another French liqueur called yellow chartreuse, introduced in 1838.\n\nShades of chartreuse\n\nEtymology\nThe French word chartreuse means 'charterhouse'.  The monasteries of the monks of the Carthusian order, of which the first one was established in 1082 by Saint Bruno, are called charter houses because they were chartered—and given generous material support—by the Duke of Burgundy, known as Philip the Bold, when he took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately decorated tomb was initially installed at a Carthusian charterhouse when he died in 1404. These monks started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764.\n\nChartreuse in nature\nYellow-green algae, also called Xanthophytes, are a class of algae in the Heterokontophyta division. Most live in fresh water, but some are found in marine and soil habitats. They vary from single-celled flagellates to simple colonial and filamentous forms. Unlike other heterokonts, the plastids of yellow-green algae do not contain fucoxanthin, which is why they have a lighter color.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nTraffic safety \nChartreuse yellow is used on traffic safety vests to provide increased visibility for employees working near traffic. The chartreuse yellow background material, together with a retro-reflective satisfy the ANSI 107-2010 standard since 1999. High-visibility clothing ANSI Standards were adopted as an Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States) requirement in 2008.\n\nFilm and television\nThe 1960 Universal film Chartroose Caboose featured a 'bright green' colored train car.\n\nIn an episode of Hogan's Heroes, the prisoners at Luftstalag Thirteen are given the task of painting the camp buildings chartreuse.\n\nFirefighting\n\nSince about 1973, a sort of fluorescent chartreuse green has been adopted as the color of fire engines in parts of the United States and elsewhere. The use of chartreuse fire engines began when New York ophthalmologist Stephen Solomon produced research claiming that sparkling bright lime-green paint would boost the night time visibility of emergency vehicles compared to those painted the traditional fire engine red. The reason for this is the Purkinje effect, i.e., the cones do not function as efficiently in dim light, so red objects appear to be black. In Australia and New Zealand this form of chartreuse yellow is also known as 'ACT yellow' as this is the color of the fire engines in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nFlags\nWhen Bharatpur State was a princely state, it was the only political entity ever to have a chartreuse yellow-colored flag.\n\nSee also\n Lime (color)\n Lists of colors\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTertiary colors\nQuaternary colors\nShades of green"},
{"id": "46626311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleftherias%20Square", "title": "Eleftherias Square", "text": "Eleftherias Square (, Platía Eleftherías, ) is a central square in downtown Thessaloniki, Greece. It takes its name from the Young Turk Revolution, which began in the square in 1908. The square is currently a car park, but a public competition was launched by the Municipality of Thessaloniki in 2013 to select a design for its redevelopment into a park. Construction will start in 2018 at a cost of €5.1 million ($ million).\n\nThe square is bound by Mitropoleos street to the north, Nikis Avenue and the old waterfront of Thessaloniki to the south, Ionos Dragoumi street to the west and Venizelou street to the east. It is trapezoidal in shape and covers an area of approximately . The square is surrounded by banks, insurance companies, and offices.\n\nOn 11 July 1942, thousands of Greek Jewish men were rounded up, publicly tortured and humiliated before being registered for forced labour during the Holocaust in Greece.\n\nHistory \n\nBefore becoming a square, the Walls of Thessaloniki ran through the site, along with a Byzantine-era tower to guard the entrance of the port. In the Ottoman period this tower was called  (Cannon House). After 1870, when the demolition of the southern and eastern city walls began, the sea would reach the middle of the known square.\n\nThe demolition of the wall to make easier the entry to the port created more space and helped the mobility of the ships. The opening of the Mehmet Sabri Pasha road (nowadays Venizelou Street) in 1867 created a small square as the road widened towards the wharfs. It was initially called  (Wharf Square) and later  (Olympus Square) on account of the views of Mount Olympus across the sea. During the late Ottoman Empire the square became an important cosmopolitan centre of the neighbourhood, known as  (, European or Frankish Quarter), and the wider city. It also evolved into centre of commerce and finance, making Thessaloniki the financial capital of the Ottoman Balkans and a substantial economic player in the eastern Mediterranean. The buildings of the Bank of Salonica, the Bank of the Orient, and the Ottoman Bank were all within walking distance of a square. The Olympos Hôtel, including its restaurant, as well as the Hôtel Royale, were focal points of the early Ottoman square. The square itself became the point of entry to the city for visitors travelling by boat.\n\nBeginning in 1893, a rapid transit system is implemented in Thessaloniki by means of a tram network, with Eleftherias Square as the western starting point. Later in the decade the square is lit as part of the introduction of gas lighting in the city, while in 1908 the tram network passing through the square is electrified.\n\nIn April 1903, Bulgarian anarchists, members of the Boatmen of Thessaloniki, plant a bomb at a beer hall on the square; this was part of a coordinated terrorist attack which also saw the sinking of the French ship  and the bombing nearby Ottoman Bank among others. This event was the starting point of the Macedonian Struggle.\n\nThe rise of Thessaloniki as an Ottoman economic powerhouse meant an increase in western travellers, which rendered the original square unfit to cater to their needs. Between 1898 and 1911, the square was entirely rebuilt. Initially, the  is expanded and renamed ; soon after, the  is demolished and rebuilt. The Ahmet and Mehmet Kamapci brothers, who owned , built another luxury hotel on the square, the , while the , the city's then most modern building, was completed in 1911 under the sponsorship of mayor Hulusi Bey. The  also opened on the square, as well as numerous cafés, restaurants, and pâtisseries.\n\nThe Jewish , with its library, was also based in the square. It was an upper class progressive society promoting philanthropy and various Jewish causes but at the same time pro-Ottoman and vehemently anti-Zionist; this created a lot of friction between the  and the , a rival pro-Zionist private members club on the waterfront which split from the . In his state visit to Thessaloniki in 1908, Sultan Abdulhamid II's official procession passed through the square and in front of the . The standards at the  were so high that they impressed a visiting British gentleman.\n\nThe events of the Young Turk Revolution gave the square its current name. The Young Turks began the revolution in Thessaloniki and Enver Pasha declared to a crowd gathered on Eleftherias Square that 'today the capricious ruler has ended, bad government is no more. We are all brothers. There are no Bulgars, Greeks, Serbs, Romanians, Jews, Muslims. Under the blue sky we are all equal, we are proud to be Ottomans!' In old Ottoman and Greek postcards, it henceforth appears in French as Place de la Liberté (Liberty Square).\n\nAfter Thessaloniki became part of Greece in 1913, the Liberal Association of Macedonia, the first Liberal Club in Greece, was opened on one of the buildings around the square in January 1916. It was an organisation supporting and promoting the causes of the Liberal Party and Eleftherios Venizelos, as Thessaloniki and the rest of Northern Greece were a Liberal stronghold at the time; the Liberal Club was the most successful in Greece at influencing official policy. During the First World War the square was popular with Allied troops of the 'five-nation army' fighting in the Salonica Front, especially Café Flokas, the most famous pâtisserie in the city, where a Scottish volunteer nurse notes that 'warriors [were] at last able to relax, drink, smoke, and discuss the newest singers at the city's café-chantants'.\n\nAfter the Great Fire \n\nThe Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 destroyed the original character of the square, with only the Stein Building, an Austrian department store, being spared. Because Thessaloniki was to be a planned city after the Fire the Government had issued a ban on reconstructions in any of the burnt-out areas of the city before the new plan could be finalised. The importance of Eleftherias Square to the life of Thessaloniki is illustrated by the fact that special Royal Decrees were issued, allowing establishments such as  to be rebuilt temporarily.\n\nThe redesign commission, headed by French architect Ernest Hébrard, sought to replace the square with the regional offices of the  (), as the square had become obsolete after the design of the nearby Aristotelous Square. Banks and other buildings would be constructed around the public building, named  (), and the waterfront promenade would be extended to provide some further public space. A small new square would be created there, called  (). Hébrard was not the only one to submit proposals for the design of the TTT building; Greek architect Marinos Delladetsimas also produced a proposal, with obvious influences from Hébrard's Byzantine Revival style.\n\nThe plans were largely not carried out, although reconstruction began in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1921 the first plan-compliant permit was issued, while construction on a building housing the National Bank of Greece on the northwester corner of the square, as well as a building housing the Ionian Bank on the opposite side of the road, was started in the late 1920s. The National Bank of Greece opened in 1933, but the design was modified so as to also house the Bank of Greece, which had been established in 1928. Work on the foundations for  commenced in 1931, but was hampered by the discovery of the sea wall which had been demolished in the late 1800s. This created major structural issues, and the project stalled and was abandoned. With the occupation of the city by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1941, the building of the Ionian Bank was requisitioned by the German authorities and turned into the local , the headquarters of the occupying authority. The Ionian Bank later became the Ionian and Popular Bank, which is now Alpha Bank; it still occupies the building.\n\nDuring and after World War II \n\nIn the summer of 1942, the day which became known as 'black Shabbat', all Jewish men aged from 18 to 45 were commanded to present themselves at the square to be put to forced labour. On the same day, 6,000 or 7,000 of them were gathered in the square, guarded by armed German soldiers. The gathered crowd was publicly tortured and humiliated before being registered. The Nazis requested a ₯2.5 billion ransom to release the Jews from forced labour, which the community paid to them. Between 15 March and August 7, 1943 Thessaloniki's 56,000 Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps. 96% of the prewar Jewish population was murdered.\n\nAfter the Second World War the project to erect TTT House on the square was abandoned when it was officially proclaimed a public space on 6 April 1963 by order of the Ministry for Public Works. The Hellenic Post contested the decision but was unsuccessful in convincing the courts. It was subsequently turned into a parking lot and bus terminal, opened by the Hellenic Tourism Organisation as the only public parking facility in the city. This was unsuccessfully contested again in 1972. The removal of the parking and the redevelopment of the area back into an open square was first discussed in 1997, when Thessaloniki became the European Capital of Culture, but was ultimately abandoned due to the high costs of construction an underground parking facility. A Holocaust memorial was created in by Serbian holocaust survivor Nandor Glid 1997, but was only placed in the southern corner of the square in 2006. The monument was defiled twice in 2018, once by Golden Dawn members in January, and once by far-right protesters participating in a Macedonia naming dispute rally. Thessaloniki mayor Yiannis Boutaris, who championed the redevelopment of the square back into an open space, challenged the memorial as being 'hard to find'. In the same speech in 2018 he outlined the reasons behind the Municipality's insistence regarding the redevelopment of a square, saying:\n\nA design competition was launched in 2013, and in 2018 the tendering process to select a contractor to carry out building works was commenced. The total budget for the redevelopment of the square currently stands at €5.1 million ($ million), funded by a loan from the European Investment Bank. By March 2019 the parking facilities on the square had been closed in preparation to the redevelopment.\n\nArchitectural character\n\nThe original aesthetic of Eleftherias Square was influenced by the Western European Belle Époque style at a time when much of Thessaloniki was orientalist in character, with narrow streets and a lack of even basic European city-planning. The area of the square had, at the time, become the city's cosmopolitan centre and European-style buildings in the eclectic style began to be constructed, including examples of Ottoman neoclassicism and baroque. During that time the square was much narrower than the one designed after the fire, but it was still the largest public square in Ottoman Thessaloniki.\n\nBank buildings\n\nTransport\n\nThere are numerous modes of public transport that make the square accessible. The bus terminal at the north of the square is operated by the Thessaloniki Urban Transport Organisation (OASTH). Buses 05 (including 05A and 05B), 06, 33 (including 33A), and 35 stop at the square, and there is a dedicated ticket kiosk. The Thessaloniki Waterbus network has its terminus at the Port of Thessaloniki opposite the square. Thessaloniki Metro's  station, a short walk from the square on the corner of Venizelou and Egnatia streets, will also serve the square beginning in 2021; it will be served by both Line 1 and Line 2.\n\nThe square is also accessible by car. A parking lot has occupied entire square since the 1960s, but it is not known where the parking will be relocated following the redevelopment of the square. No provisions for underground parking have been made, which has led to questions being raised within the city council. The parking currently provides the Municipality of Thessaloniki with €1.2 million ($ million) in yearly revenues, something which will end with the redevelopment of the square back into a public space without parking provisions.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe events leading up to the destruction of the Jews of Thessaloniki were portrayed in a 2015 film by Manousos Manousakis titled . Because of the significant change in the architectural character of the square, and the fact that it is now a car park, the scene depicting the registration of the Jews on Eleftherias Square was filmed at Kotzia Square in Athens.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nSquares in Thessaloniki\nThe Holocaust in Thessaloniki\nModern history of Thessaloniki"},

{"id": "39715406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold%20Fast%20%28album%29", "title": "Hold Fast (album)", "text": "Hold Fast was the second full length studio album released by Sheffield-based indie pop group The Crookes.  Produced by long-time collaborator Matt Peel, it was recorded in February 2012 and released on Fierce Panda Records on 9 July 2012.  Three tracks from the album were released as singles, and the album generally received positive reviews in the media.\n\nHold Fast was the first Crookes album to feature guitarist Tom Dakin, who was brought in to temporarily fill in on an autumn tour of Europe and the UK when founding member Alex Saunders left the band in September 2011; Dakin has since become a permanent member of the band. As was the case with their 2010 EP Dreaming of Another Day and 2011 debut album Chasing After Ghosts, all lyrics on this album were penned by guitarist Daniel Hopewell.\n\nBackground\nHopewell was inspired to title the album Hold Fast after a late night conversation the band had with friend Richard Hawley, in which Hawley explained to them that '...sailors used to tattoo 'HOLD FAST' across their knuckles...they couldn't hear each other speak because of all the gunshots, but they [had] tattooed 'HOLD FAST' [on their hands] and they'd grip onto their oars and keep going, and eventually all the blood would drain from their hands, but the message would still be there [visible] in ink. And I just thought it was such a fantastic metaphor for being in a band, for sticking it out and keeping going that it seemed the most perfect song choice and title choice for this album.'\n\nTo raise funds for touring and other incidentals, the Crookes started a PledgeMusic campaign in spring 2012 based around the release of Hold Fast. Fans who pre-ordered Hold Fast through the project had exclusive access to purchase limited edition and rare Crookes merchandise such as shirts worn by the band, signed guitars, and personalised lyric sheets, as well as to purchase unusual special events like a private guitar lesson with the band to learn a Crookes song, a gig in a fan's living room, and a five-a-side football match in which the band themselves would play the sport with their fans.\n\nThe Crookes' PledgeMusic campaign site provided a physical location to host fan exclusives, including the 'Hold Fast Interviews' series in which the band members took turns interviewing each other on camera.  In the series, Hopewell was interviewed by drummer Russell Bates and revealed that Hold Fast was a happier album lyrically than Chasing After Ghosts because he suffers 'quite badly from seasonal affective disorder' and 'in winter when it's cold, I just generally find it impossible to write happy songs because I'm always quite miserable, but then this last album, which was written while we were abroad, and it was sunny, and it was an incredible time, so I think it was impossible for me to be unhappy when it is like that.'  When the album was released in July 2012, the campaign had raised funds over 124% of the band's original goal.  The campaign's Web site stated that 'a percentage of our proceeds [will go] to Sheffield Children's Hospital Charity Fund...'\n\nHopewell has admitted in interviews that ninth track 'Where Did Our Love Go?' is a 'painfully honest' account of emotions surrounding founding member Alex Saunders' voluntary decision to leave the band in 2011 but the process of writing the lyrics to the song proved 'quite cathartic'. The words to closing track 'The I Love You Bridge' were based on a real life marriage proposal that was spray painted in April 2001 to the side of a bridge in Park Hill, a Sheffield council housing estate east of the city centre; the message on the bridge has since become an iconic landmark in the city.  Singer and bassist George Waite had seen a newspaper article about the bridge, saved the newspaper clipping, and displayed it prominently on their refrigerator door, hoping that Hopewell would 'pick up on it' and find the story interesting enough to write a song about its history. Hopewell has explained, 'The fact which illuminated the phrase ‘I love you, will you marry me?’ is that they left the name just as it is and that in itself sounds like a Crookes song – that kind of idea with a name framed for obscurity that runs through a lot of our songs. I think we often get labelled as romantics, which is fair to a certain extent, but a lot of the time that conjures up a slightly wide-eyed image as the reality of a lot of romance is really dark and associated with things like death and suicide. Apparently, twenty-six people killed themselves by jumping from this landmark, and that idea that people kill themselves from the thing called ‘I Love You Bridge’ was incredible and very inspiring.”\n\nThe album was recorded in March 2012 at Cottage Road Studios in Leeds by Matt Peel, who was also on production duties for their 2011 debut album Chasing After Ghosts.\n\nRelease\nThe release of Hold Fast was preceded by the release of single 'Afterglow' in April 2012.  To promote the release of the album, in early May on their Tumblr the band gave away the track 'American Girls', which was released as a single in its own right in November 2012.\n\nOn 11 June 2013, the Crookes announced they had signed their first American recording contract with Austin-based indie label Modern Outsider, stating further that they would be releasing a special version of Hold Fast in America later in 2013 and would be playing live dates there before the end of the year. Modern Outsider revealed on 17 July 2013 that the American version of Hold Fast, including bonus tracks of previously released UK 'Afterglow' b-side 'Honey' and May 2013 singles 'Bear's Blood' and 'Dance in Colour,' will be released in the U.S. on 1 October 2013.\n\nTrack listing\n\nReception \n\nHold Fast generally received good reviews by the online music press and was supported by BBC radio presenters Steve Lamacq, Chris Hawkins and Shaun Keaveny on BBC Radio 6 Music.  Influential British music magazine Q appreciated the album's brevity yet substance, saying, 'Not a second on these 33 watertight minutes are wasted.' Laura Prior of God is in the TV complimented the whimsy of the release, stating, 'In short, if you have a passing interest in placing your arms in upwardly turned right angles and doing the invisible hoola [sic] hoop, this album will pay furious dividends. Surely there can be no higher praise?' Linda Aust of This Is Fake DIY said of the album, 'The Crookes have managed to create a homogenous and varied album that might have fit better into the 60s but is nonetheless utterly listenable with its characteristically retro feel, abundance of jangly guitars and soaring vocals. Framed by vibrant harmonies and perfect pop, The Crookes definitely deserve their break-through this time around.'\n\nIn his review for The Fly, Robert Cooke said, 'They’re a dying breed are bands like The Crookes, making romantic rock ‘n’ roll the old-fashioned way. This lovestruck lot wear their hearts on their sleeves, and they sure has hell don’t hide their hooks. ‘Hold Fast’ is easily their finest work yet, from the hormone-fuelled thrills of ‘Afterglow’ to the startling sincerity of ‘The I Love You Bridge.’' In reviewing the album for the BBC, Mike Diver praised the vocals of lead singer Waite: 'The Crookes better hold attentions when they slow down. The I Love You Bridge is a beautiful closer with a committed, affecting lead vocal from George Waite, and the a cappella intro to American Girls is of equal appeal.'\n\nIn her review of Hold Fast, Mary Chang of There Goes the Fear said of the album, 'They haven’t changed their sound so much to the point of unrecognisable from their previous releases; what they have done is started playing and writing smarter, both instrumentally and lyrically...With complaints far and wide that guitar rock is dead, ‘Hold Fast’ flies in the face of these ill-begotten rumours and grins widely.' Simon Franklin of The Upcoming described the album as one 'that requires more than one listen for it’s [sic] more hidden joys on some of the tracks, and the more upbeat sounds such as Afterglow are instantly favourites producing a diverse and fun album.'\n\nPersonnel \n\nRussell Bates (drums)\nDaniel Hopewell (guitar)\nGeorge Waite (vocals, bass guitar)\nTom Dakin (guitar)\n\nReferences\n\n2012 albums\nFierce Panda Records albums\nThe Crookes albums"},

It was discovered on 26 January 1938, by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland. It was later named after writer Frans Eemil Sillanpää.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nThe S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest populations of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,229 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic.\nSillanpää was first identified as  at Simeiz Observatory in 1935, while its observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Turku in 1938.\n\nLightcurves \n\nIn March 2009, Czech astronomer Petr Pravec obtained a rotational light-curve from photometric observations at Ondřejov Observatory. It gave a well-defined rotation period of 9.6602 hours with a brightness variation of 0.55 magnitude (). One month later, a concurring period of 9.659 hours with an amplitude of 0.71 magnitude was obtained by Adrián Galád at Modra Observatory (). Photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in December 2011. gave a 9.6597 hours and Δ0.59 in magnitude (). A modeled light-curve using data from the Uppsala\nAsteroid Photometric Catalogue and other data sources, gave a period of 9.65855 hours, as well as a spin axis of (129.0°, 76.0°) in ecliptic coordinates ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Sillanpää measures between 7.35 and 8.76 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.21 and 0.327. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an intermediate albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this asteroid family – and calculates a larger diameter of 8.19 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 12.6.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after one of the most famous Finnish writers, Frans Eemil Sillanpää (1888–1964), first Finnish writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939 (also see List of Laureates since 1901).

The church, located at 509 N. Florida Avenue, is predominantly a Romanesque structure, with other elements.  The church is home to Sacred Heart Parish, part of the West Hillsborough Deanery of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe first Catholic parish on Florida's West Coast was established in 1860 and named St. Louis Parish in honor of Fr. Luis de Cancer, a Dominican missionary who was martyred on the shores of Tampa Bay in 1549.  The initial wooden-frame building called St. Louis Church was erected on the site where Sacred Heart stands today. In 1888, the Jesuits took over the pastoral responsibilities of the parish, after a serious outbreak of yellow fever in Tampa took the lives of three diocesan priests. Using Tampa as their base, the Jesuits were given the responsibility of all of South Florida by Bishop Moore. In 1905, a new Church was constructed in Romanesque style and the parish was renamed Sacred Heart.\n\nAs Tampa grew, so did the parish, and by 1897 it was decided that a new church was needed. Construction on the church began with a groundbreaking on February 16, 1898, with the laying of the cornerstone taking place on February 4, 1900. The dedication of Sacred Heart Church took place on January 15, 1905, and at that time the parish was renamed Sacred Heart Parish.\n\nThe architect for the new Sacred Heart Church was Nicholas J. Clayton of Galveston, TX, who designed many Roman Catholic Churches in Texas and throughout the southern United States. The granite and marble structure includes a 135-foot dome, solid oak pews and doors, porcelain tiles, and a Carrara marble altar. Its 70 stained glass windows were designed and manufactured for Sacred Heart by Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, Germany.  The facility is a popular location for weddings, having hosted weddings for some parish families going back as many as six generations.\n\nThe parish operated a school, Sacred Heart Academy, which it established in 1931, on Florida Avenue in the city's Tampa Heights neighborhood. However, due to the changing demographics of the immediate area, Sacred Heart Academy was forced to close at the end of the 2011–12 school year. Previously affiliated with Sacred Heart Parish was another Tampa institution, Jesuit High School, founded in 1899, which thrives today.\n\nIn 2005, after the 100th anniversary of Sacred Heart Church, the Jesuit community which had long served the parish withdrew in order to concentrate on their academic institutions throughout the South. The fourth bishop of the Diocese of St. Petersburg, Most Rev. Robert Lynch, invited the Franciscan Friars of the Most Holy Name of Jesus Province to assume the pastoral responsibilities for the parish. The current pastor is Father Stephen Mimnaugh, OFM. In 2010 the Diocese of St. Petersburg added a Catholic Heritage Marker to the church exterior, recognizing its historic significance.\n\nSee also \n\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Saint Petersburg\nSt. Louis Catholic Cemetery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nSacred Heart Catholic Church - Official Web Site\nPhoto of the West Edifice\nPhotos of Sacred Heart's Stained Glass Windows\nHoly Name Province - Official Web Site of the parish Franciscans\n\nRoman Catholic churches in Tampa, Florida\nRoman Catholic churches in Florida\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Saint Petersburg\nHistory of Tampa, Florida\nRoman Catholic churches completed in 1905\nRomanesque Revival church buildings in Florida\n1905 establishments in Florida\n20th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States"},

{"id": "24507620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Ramsey%20Show", "title": "The Ramsey Show", "text": "The Ramsey Show (formerly known as The Dave Ramsey Show) is a three-hour self-syndicated radio program and podcast, hosted by the eponymous finance author and speaker Dave Ramsey, that airs Monday through Friday from 2-5 PM ET. It is broadcast from Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nRamsey takes live calls on the theme of finance, and occasionally money-related Christian philosophy as it pertains to tithing, etc.  During the show, he discusses life and money-related issues with callers. He is known for his complete disdain of debt collectors, calling them (among other things) 'scum' and dishonest, and urging his listeners not to deal with them unless necessary, and then to get everything in writing, especially involving offers to reduce debts. One notable difference between his and other financial shows is that Ramsey attempts to go beyond mathematical mechanics and reach his callers on an emotional and spiritual level.\n\nThe Ramsey Show has a channel on iHeartRadio and Sirius XM. , it is one of the top five most-listened-to radio shows.\n\nHistory \nThe program began June 15, 1992, when Ramsey, selling copies of Financial Peace out of the trunk of his car, was a guest on 99.7 WWTN.  The station had recently filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and one of its hosts had quit after not getting paid, which left the station scrambling to fill the gap in its lineup. Ramsey offered to do a one-hour show for free for one month, not entirely expecting to be successful. The Money Game went on the air with Ramsey, Hal Wilson and Roy Matlock each hosting the hour alone on certain days of the week. Ramsey was the bankruptcy and 'get out of debt' guru on Mondays and Wednesdays, Matlock answered investing questions Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Wilson's Friday topic was primarily real estate. After station management asked Wilson to discontinue his portion of the program, Ramsey and Matlock teamed up to host the show five days per week. Eventually, Matlock left the show on good terms to focus on his financial services business, leaving Ramsey to host the show alone.\n\nThe program became quite popular in Nashville. Reportedly, when WWTN asked Ramsey who would be syndicating his show, Ramsey simply pointed to Blake Thompson, who continues as executive producer of the show to this day. As Bill Hampton, Vice President of The Lampo Group stated, 'they learned syndication from the ground up.'\n\nThe Money Game changed its name to The Dave Ramsey Show in mid-1996. In 2006, the show received two nominations for the 2006 Radio & Records News/Talk Industry Achievement Awards. It is the fifth year in a row for Dave Ramsey in the 'Syndicated Personality of the Year' category, and the second year in a row for Bill Hampton in the 'Executive of the Year' category.\n\nOn the success of the show, Bill Hampton stated that it did $2.5 million in network sales in 2005 while MyTMMO.com did $1.2 million. He also stated the show would bring in an estimated $3.7 million from advertisers.  The show is now also available on podcast via iTunes.\n\nRamsey's show is one of very few national radio shows to be self-syndicated. The program is not connected to any national network or programming service, and is distributed directly to local stations. Ramsey's show is fed to stations 24/7 so that stations will not have to record his show for later broadcast, but rather they can always use the satellite feed. The show is distributed via Westwood One's satellite platform.\n\nAfter 20 years of broadcasting on WTN, on January 1, 2013, the show moved to 102.5 FM ('The Game'). Ramsey and WTN were unable to come to terms over a renewal contract. One year later, on January 1, 2014, the show moved to WLAC.\n\n, the show is heard on more than 600 stations.\n\n'Seven Baby Steps' Formula \nWith a simple, seven-stage 'baby steps' formula (Baby Step Two is based on the debt-snowball method), Ramsey urges listeners to avoid all debt except for certain types of home mortgages.\n\nRamsey's Seven Baby Steps are:\n\n1. Save $1,000 for a starter emergency fund.\n\n2. Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt snowball.\n\n3. Save 3-6 months expenses in a fully funded emergency fund.\n\n4. Invest 15% of household income in retirement.\n\n5. Save for children's college fund.\n\n6. Pay off home early.\n\n7. Build wealth and give.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nAmerican talk radio programs\niHeartMedia radio stations\nMass media in Nashville, Tennessee\nSirius XM Radio channels\nSirius XM Radio programs"},
{"id": "9138777", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Field%20Artillery%20March", "title": "U.S. Field Artillery March", "text": "The 'U.S. Field Artillery March' is a patriotic military march of the United States Army written in 1917 by John Philip Sousa, based on an earlier work by Edmund L. Gruber.  The refrain is the 'Caissons Go Rolling Along'.  This song inspired the official song of the U.S. Army which is called 'The Army Goes Rolling Along'.\n\nBackground\nSousa served in the United States Marine Corps, and was a member of the U.S. Navy during World War I.  He was asked by Army Lieutenant George Friedlander, of the 306th Field Artillery, to compose a march for his regiment.  Friedlander suggested it be built around a song already known as The Caisson Song (alternatively The Field Artillery Song or The Caissons Go Rolling Along).  The song was thought to perhaps be of Civil War origin, and was unpublished, and its composer believed to be dead. Sousa agreed, changed the harmonic structure, set it in a different key, refined the melody, made the rhythm more snappy, and added further new material.\n\nSousa and Lieutenant Friedlander were surprised to later learn that the composer of The Caisson Song was still living and that the song had been written in 1908 by artillery First Lieutenant (later Brigadier General) Edmund L. Gruber, with some help on the lyrics from Lieutenant William Bryden, and Lieutenant (later Major General) Robert M. Danford, while stationed at Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines.  Reportedly, Gruber may have been influenced by music composed by Alfred C. Montin at Fort Sheridan in Illinois, shortly before his unit was transferred to Fort Sill in Oklahoma.\n\nIt appears that Gruber did not object to Sousa's use of the song, at least not initially, and that Sousa passed on his royalties to Gruber. However, other sources state that Gruber became involved in a prolonged legal battle to recover the rights to the music he had written and that had been lifted (unknowingly or not) by Sousa and widely sold by sheet music publishers who reaped profits while Gruber received nothing. The music became so popular that it was also used in radio ads by firms such as the Hoover Vacuum Company.  Gruber's position was rejected by the courts, which ruled that he had waited too long to complain and that his music was by that time in the public domain.\n\nLyrics\n\nThe lyrics as of 1918 are as follows:\n\nOver hill, over dale,\nWe will hit the dusty trail,\nAnd those Caissons go rolling along.\n\nin and out, hear them shout!\nCounter marching all about,\nAnd those Caissons go rolling along,\n\nFor it's high high he,\nIn the Field Artillery,\nShout out your 'No' [numbers] loud and strong,\n\nFor wher-e’er we go,\nYou will always know,\nThat those Caissons go rolling along.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nOver hill, over dale,\nAs we hit the dusty trail\nAnd the Caissons go rolling along.\nIn and out, hear them shout!\nCounter march and right about,\nAnd the Caissons go rolling along.\n\nThen it's Heigh!

It is the third film in the film series based on the arcade game and anime television series PriPara. The film was released in Japan by Avex Pictures on March 12, 2016.\n\nPlot\nLaala is spending a normal day in Pripara with her friends, when they are all transported to the Pripara Grand Canyon. Meganii and Meganee explain that they received a distress call from Falulu in Pripari, the world headquarters of all Pripara, located in Prance. Falulu warns everyone that ominous black clouds have appeared above the Eppel Tower and that Pripari is beginning to lose its Sparkle power. The message is cut short before Falulu can elaborate further but Meganii explains that if Pripara loses all its Sparkle then they can no longer be idols. Meganii goes on to explain that the idols must travel to Pripari if they hope to save Pripara for everyone. He also explains that on the way they should perform as much as they can in order to collect Sparkle, or likes, from idols all over the world. Meganee reveals vehicles for all the idols, saying that they cannot use any normal transport, such as the Pritrain or Pricopter, as all forms of transport have become unusable since the disturbance in Pripari. Meganee tells the idols that the entrance to Pripari is at the end of the canyon and that they should hurry.\n\nIn Pripari, Falulu begins to fall into a coma, Unicorn explains to Gaaruru that because Falulu was born from the Sparkle power, she and the other Mini Falulu will disappear too, if Pripara is not saved. Gaaruru is unaffected as she was born from the negative feelings of girls who struggled to become idols, opposite to Falulu. Laala and her friends start heading through the canyon, but when they reach the entrance to Pripari, they find Aromageddon have beaten them there. Aroma reveals she plans to get to Pripari first, then seal the entrance with an explosive, but Mikan detonates the explosive prematurely, causing everyone to be blasted out of Pripara to various locations around the world.\n\nLaala, Mirei and Sophy end up in Osaka, where they locate the local Pripara in an Aquarium. They perform for the local idols and collect their likes before continuing on to Pripari. Sion, Dorothy and Reona end up in the United States of Pamerica, where they find the Arepa 51 Pripara to perform at, before continuing on and getting lost in the Gobi desert where they meet Hibiki. Unfortunately the Gobi desert has a side effect of causing people to use sentence enders, which Hibiki hates more than anything. Hibiki is forced to perform in order to cause an oasis to appear and save Dressing Pafe from dying of thirst. Afterwards the three idols thank Hibiki, but are surprised when she begins using 'Pri' as a sentence ender, making them laugh. Hibiki angrily storms off out of the desert with Dressing Pafe in pursuit. Aroma and Mikan end up in Pegypt, where Mikan is able to reveal the entrance to Pegypt's Pripara in a Pyramid under a lake where they perform to get likes. Ajimi ends up lost in the Atlantic Ocean but manages to get to the Palps and meet up with Fuwari who has managed to get home to visit her grandfather. The two idols perform a duet for Fuwari's grandfather before continuing on to Pripari. The other idols, which include Sophy's Royal Guard, Laala's friends Nao, Eiko, Love, Ran the ghost girl and Nanami the leader of Pink Actress, all arrive in New York where they end up at the Pripara Fancy Club. Unfortunately the idols learn that the club holds idol deathmatches and that they cannot leave unless they win their match. The idols select Chanko of the Royal Guard to fight as she is the most macho. Chanko reluctantly agrees, winning her match and performing afterwards for likes.\n\nSoLaMi Smile and Dressing Pafe reach Pripari first, and find the city size Pripara covered by black clouds and the Prisian idols acting strangely, saying they hate everything. But Dorothy discovers she can use the power of the likes stored in her Cyalume Charm to change the Prisians back to normal. SoLaMi Smile and Dressing Pafe head to where Falulu is and learn from Gaaruru the reason for the black clouds appearing. It transpires that when Falulu and Gaaruru returned to Pripari they came with Gloria Ookanda, who met her older sister Ploria when they landed on top of the Eppel Tower. At first the sisters excitedly greeted each other but then began arguing over something trivial. It is this argument that formed the clouds and spread the negative aura over Pripari, and the sisters are still fighting, continuing to create the clouds. Gaaruru explains that Falulu may be able to help them reach the two Ookanda sisters, but she has fallen into a coma with the other mini Falulu. Laala and her friends try to use their Cyalume Charms to wake up Falulu but they don't have enough likes. But when all seems hopeless, the other idols appear and use their charms to wake Falulu up. All the idols then perform a live in front of the Eppel Tower, causing the sisters to come to their senses and stop fighting, restoring Pripari and saving Pripara. The Ookanda sisters forgive each other and Laala and her friends return to Japan.\n\nIn a post credits scene, Laala is awoken by Non, who tells her a new idol group has appeared in Pripara. Meganii reveals the group to be Junon, Pinon and Kanon of Triangle, before addressing the audience, saying he will look forward to meeting them again in Pripara next time.\n\nCast\n\nHimika Akaneya as Laala Manaka\nYū Serizawa as Mirei Minami\nMiyu Kubota as Sophy Hōjō\nSaki Yamakita as Sion Tōdō\nAzuki Shibuya as Dorothy West\nYūki Wakai as Reona West\nYui Makino as Aroma Kurosu\nYui Watanabe as Mikan Shiratama\nAzusa Satō as Fuwari Midorikaze\nMitsuki Saiga as Hibiki Shikyoin\nReina Ueda as Ajimi Kiki\nChinatsu Akasaki as Falulu and Chanko\nAsami Sanada as Gaaruru\nUrara Takano as Gloria Ōokanda\nKanae Itō as Meganee Akai\nJunichi Suwabe as Meganii Akai\nMinami Tanaka as Non Manaka/Triangle\nYoshino Nanjou as Nao\nAina Kusuda as Sadako\nSarah Emi Bridcutt as Eiko\nTakuma Terashima as Rei Andō\nYukiko Morishita as Love Tochiotome\nYuka Inokuchi as Ran\nRina Kawaei as Mini-Falulu\nYoshino Nanjou as Nanami\nChihiro Suzuki as Kuma\nTakuma Terashima as Usagi\nHiromi Konno as Neko\nRikako Aikawa as Toriko\nIkue Ōtani as Unicorn\nHirofumi Nojima as Ham\n\nProduction\nThe film was announced in October 2015.

{"id": "66896156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suhayra%20Aden", "title": "Suhayra Aden", "text": "Suhayra Aden (born 1995) is a New Zealand woman who travelled to Syria in 2014. It is alleged that while in Syria she joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) where she married two Swedish fighters and had three children. In February 2021, she was detained by Turkish authorities while trying to enter the country with her two surviving children. Turkey subsequently dropped charges against Aden and began proceedings to deport her.\n\nFormerly a dual citizen, Aden was stripped of her Australian citizenship in 2020 as a result of allegedly engaging in terrorism. The move was announced and defended by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison; it was met with scepticism internationally and uproar in New Zealand. Australia has a history of deporting non-citizens who have committed crimes or breached their 'character test,' regardless of whether they have only ever committed crimes in Australia, or if they spent virtually their whole lives in Australia. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern accused Morrison's government of trying to abandon Aden (who had lived in Australia since the age of 6 before allegedly joining ISIL) so New Zealand would have to deal with her and the associated expenses instead. Following a phone conversation, the two leaders agreed to work together in the 'spirit of the Australian-New Zealand relationship' to address what Ardern called 'quite a complex legal situation.'\n\nOn 26 July 2021, Ardern announced that Cabinet had agreed to repatriate Aden and her two children on the basis of their status as New Zealand citizens. Aden and her two children will be the first New Zealanders to be repatriated from Syria allegedly associated with ISIL. In mid-August 2021, Aden and her two children landed in New Zealand.\n\nBackground\nSuhayra Aden was born in 1995 in Auckland's Mount Roskill suburb. Aden grew up in a Somalian refugee family who had become New Zealand citizens. According to a 1 News report, her father was unemployed while her mother was a housewife. At the age of six, she and her family emigrated to Melbourne, Australia where they subsequently acquired Australian citizenship.\n\nJoining ISIL and repatriation\nIn 2014, Aden traveled to Syria via Turkey and lived under the Islamic State. According to ABC News journalist Dylan Welch, she experienced second thoughts and unsuccessfully attempted to call her mother in order to return to Australia. However, she was part of a group bound for Syria and was unable to escape from them. She subsequently traveled in a van to ISIL-controlled territory. While there, she married and had three children with two Swedish men. One of her children subsequently died of pneumonia in Syria.\n\nBetween September and October 2019, the ABC journalists Dylan Welch and Suzanne Drudge met Aden and her children at the Al-Hawl refugee camp in Syria while on an assignment to interview several Australian women who had joined ISIL. Aden reportedly expressed her desire to return to Australia. In 2020, the Australian Government stripped her of her Australian citizenship, leaving her as a New Zealand national. On 15 February 2021, she and her two surviving children (who both have New Zealand citizenship) were detained by Turkish authorities while crossing the border from Idlib. The border crossing was an attempt to escape ISIL. The Turkish Ministry of National Defence alleged that Aden was an ISIL terrorist. On 20 February, the Turkish Government dropped charges against Aden and began proceedings to deport her.\n \nOn 9 March 2021, Radio New Zealand reported than an unidentified Turkish Foreign Ministry official stated that New Zealand Foreign Affairs officials had indicated they would take Aden home but to expect delays due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. That same day, an unidentified New Zealand cabinet minister stated that Aden would be 'free subject to conditions' upon returning to New Zealand. Justice Minister Andrew Little and Police Minister Poto Williams indicated that Aden would be subject to monitoring under 'Control Orders,' which were criticized by Opposition Leader Judith Collins as insufficient.\n\nOn 26 July 2021, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that Cabinet had agreed to repatriate Aden and her two children back to New Zealand. They have been held in an immigration detention centre in Turkey since 15 February 2021. Aden and her two children, who are New Zealand citizens by birth and descent, became the responsibility of the New Zealand government after Australia stripped Aden's Australian citizenship in 2020. Ardern stated that the welfare and best interests of Aden's children were the primary concern. She also reassured the public that great care was being taken to ensure that the family's return to New Zealand was being managed in a way that minimises any risk to New Zealanders. Details about the repatriation arrangements will not be made public for legal, operational and security reasons. However, it is expected that Aden will be subject to conditions under the Terrorism Suppression (Control Orders) Act 2019 upon arrival back in New Zealand. Additionally, New Zealand government agencies are ensuring that appropriate actions are taken to address potential security concerns and that the right support is available to support the family's reintegration.\n\nThe New Zealand Police have confirmed that they are undertaking a terrorism investigation. Massey University teaching fellow Dr John Battersby, who specialises in counter-terrorism and intelligence said that Aden would be interviewed upon arrival to New Zealand to ascertain the extent of her involvement and association with ISIL. This information would then be used to determine whether or not Aden posed a risk to the safety of New Zealanders. Battersby stated that it would be highly, highly unlikely that Aden would be charged with terrorism offences under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 given the difficulty of obtaining evidence from Syria.\n\nAccording to Aden's lawyer, Deborah Manning, she is 'looking forward to being in New Zealand and giving her children an opportunity at living here and integrating, and really wishes to have privacy for them to allow them to settle in here and come to terms with everything they have been through.' By contrast, in late July 2021, Collins described Aden as a terrorist for marrying into the Islamic State 'death cult,' questioning the sufficiency of security arrangements.\n\nOn 21 August 2021, Aden and her two children arrived in New Zealand on an Air New Zealand flight. They entered into managed isolation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Prime Minister Ardern and the New Zealand Police also confirmed that preparations had been made to facilitate Aden and her children's return and resettlement in New Zealand. Aden's lawyer stated that Aden was looking forward to living with her children in New Zealand but wanted privacy to deal with everything they had encountered.\n\nPolitical responses\nThe Australian Government's decision to revoke Aden's Australian citizenship was criticised by Ardern, who accused Australia of abdicating its responsibilities to its citizens and indicated she had raised the matter with her Australian counterpart Scott Morrison. Ardern confirmed that New Zealand was providing consular support to Aden and her children. Morrison defended Australia's decision as putting Australia's national security interests first, citing legislation allowing Australia to revoke the citizenship of a dual national engaged in terrorist activities. Following a phone conversation, the two leaders agreed to work together in the 'spirit of the relationship' to address what Ardern described as 'quite a complex legal situation.'\n\nDuring a state visit to the New Zealand city of Queenstown in late May 2021, Morrison reiterated Australia's decision not to allow Aden to return on the grounds that she was not an Australian citizen. However, he indicated during discussions with Ardern that Australia would be open to giving Aden's two remaining children (aged two and five) a pathway to settling in Australia.\n\nPublic responses\nRodger Shahanan of the Australian think tank Lowy Institute stated that the New Zealand Government was legally and morally obliged to look after dual New Zealand nationals who had been stripped of their foreign nationality. By contrast, University of Auckland law Associate-Professor John Ip criticised Australia's decision to revoke Aden's citizenship as an example of 'legalised NIMBYism with dual citizens as objects.' Similarly, University of Waikato law professor Claire Breen argued that Aden's children were innocent and should be entitled to basic human rights protection including citizenship in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which both Australia and New Zealand are signatories to.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand's spokesperson Anjum Rahman called for New Zealand to establish de-radicalisation programmes based on the Australian and British models. Legal expert Paul Buchanan stated that prosecutors would have to prove that Aden supported ISIL for her to be charged under anti-terror legislation such as the Terrorism Suppression Act. Similar sentiments were echoed by University of Waikato law Professor Alexander Gillespie who stated that steps needed to be taken to integrate Aden's two children into New Zealand society.\n\nNotes and references\n\nAustralian Muslims\nAustralian Islamists\nNew Zealand Muslims\nAustralian expatriates in Syria\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant members\nLiving people\n1995 births\nPeople from Auckland\nNew Zealand people imprisoned abroad\nNew Zealand people of Somali descent\nNew Zealand emigrants to Australia\nPeople who lost Australian citizenship"},

He was the coach of the Pakistan Cricket Team from 2016 to 2019 and is the current head coach of the Sri Lanka national cricket team as of December 2020.\n\nHe coached the South African national team from 2005 to 2010, was the coach of the Australia national cricket team from 2010 until his sacking in June 2013 (then to be replaced by Darren Lehmann) and was the coach of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2016 to 2019. In December 2019, Mickey was appointed as the new head coach of Sri Lanka by the Sri Lanka Cricket replacing interim coach Rumesh Ratnayake.\n\nBiography\nArthur was born in Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa. He is an old boy of Westville Boys' High School.\n\nPlaying career\nArthur scored 6,557 runs playing for Orange Free State, Griqualand West and South Africa A before retiring in 2001.\n\nCoaching career\n\nSouth Africa \n\nArthur began his coaching career by coaching Griqualand West cricket team in the domestic competition before taking over the Eastern Cape side in 2003. In his last two series in charge Arthur managed to guide them to the finals of the Standard Bank Pro20 Series. He was a surprising choice to take over as the national coach in May 2005, succeeding Ray Jennings.\n\nHe had a tough introduction into international cricket with his first two Test series as coach happening to be against a rampant Australia, both away and at home, during which South Africa were easily beaten. An injury-hit South Africa failed to make the finals of the 2005–06 VB Series, but they did clinch a tense one-day series win over Australia at home, which culminated in an iconic match at Johannesburg.\n\nA home win over New Zealand was followed up by a disastrous tour of Sri Lanka in the summer of 2006, where South Africa lost both Tests and pulled out of a tri-series after a bomb exploded in Colombo, and failure to make the final of the ICC Champions Trophy. Successes include back-to-back Test and one-day series victories against India and Pakistan at home propelled South Africa to the top of the ODI rankings. This was a major boost prior to the 2007 Cricket World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa were, however, disappointing at the world cup. They had a roller coaster ride that included dominant wins over England, the West Indies, Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland and a narrow win over Sri Lanka but devastating losses to Australia, New Zealand and Bangladesh that cost them the number one ranking. Then they bowed out in the semifinals with their lowest ever score in a World Cup as Australia bowled them out for 149 and won by 7 wickets.\n\nThe preceding two years had been the best in South Africa's test history. Starting with the two home series wins at home against Pakistan and India,  Arthur lead the team through a series of 9 unbeaten test series and a number of good one-day results. This streak included wins against India, Pakistan, West Indies, New Zealand and Bangladesh at home and away wins against England, Pakistan, Bangladesh and a credible draw in India.\n\nIn 2008, Arthur became the first South African coach to guide his team to a test win in Australia. The team backed up this performance by winning the resulting One-Day International series against the odds. This unexpected 4–1 win meant that they regained the No.1 ranking in the One-Day International rankings.\n\nDuring the 2005/06 tour to Australia, he questioned the umpiring standards, claiming that the officials were biased due to overappealing by the Australian cricket team. He was cleared of the charges.\n\nIn January 2010 he resigned because of alleged differences between himself and Cricket South Africa. The reports say Cricket South Africa Chief Executive Gerald Majola will oversee the interim selection process with former South African fast bowler Corrie van Zyl and former South African captain Kepler Wessels for the two-Test and three-ODI tour of India.\n\nAustralia \nArthur was the coach of the Western Warriors and later coached the Australian cricket team. During the 2013 Australian tour of India, Arthur was criticised for his role in the Homeworkgate scandal, where he required members of the team to complete homework. He continued to coach the team until the Champions Trophy-2013 in England, where Australia crashed out in the group stages. As a pre-emptive measure ahead of the upcoming Ashes series in England, Mickey Arthur was sacked and replaced by Darren Lehmann.\n\nIn August 2013, Arthur was appointed as the head coach and director of cricket at Christ Church Grammar School, an Anglican all-boys' school in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nIn 2016, Arthur became a naturalised Australian citizen.\n\nKarachi Kings \nHe was appointed as the head coach of Karachi Kings in the debut season of Pakistan Super League which was held from 4 February 2016 to 23 February 2016 in the United Arab Emirates. They came fourth in a five-team group table due to which they had to play third-placed Islamabad United in the elimination round, where they lost by 9 wickets and were knocked-out of the tournament.\n\nOn 13 November 2019, he was replaced by Dean Jones as the head coach.\n\nDhaka Dynamites \nHe was appointed as the head coach of Dhaka Dynamites for 2015 BPL season.\n\nPakistan \n\nHe was appointed as head coach of the Pakistan Cricket Team on 6 May 2016, thus becoming a head coach of an international team for the third time. He has had his fair share of success with Pakistan. Under his guidance Pakistan became the number one ranked test and T20 side. He coached Pakistan to the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy title on 18 June, with a stunning 180 run victory against arch-rivals India in the finals. This was the first time Pakistan Cricket Team managed to win ICC Champions Trophy since the inception of the tournament in 1998. Following the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy win, Pakistan whitewashed Sri Lanka in an ODI and T20 series after losing the Test series.\n On 8 July 2018, Pakistan won a triangular series among Zimbabwe, Australia and Pakistan. Pakistan defeated Australia in the final with 6 wickets. Pakistan maintained their no. 1 ranking in T20.\n\nOn 7 August 2019, the Pakistan Cricket Board chose not to renew Arthur's contract as coach of the national side.\n\nSri Lanka \nAppointed as the coach of Sri Lanka cricket since Feb 2020.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n ICC Trophy\n\n1968 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Johannesburg\nSouth African people of British descent\nCoaches of the South Africa national cricket team\nCoaches of the Australia national cricket team\nFree State cricketers\nGriqualand West cricketers\nSouth African cricket coaches\nSouth African cricketers\nWhite South African people\nBig Bash League coaches\nPakistan Super League coaches\nBangladesh Premier League coaches\nSouth African emigrants to Australia\nSouth African expatriate sportspeople in Pakistan\nCoaches of the Pakistan national cricket team\nAustralian cricket coaches\nAustralian expatriate sportspeople in Pakistan\nNaturalised citizens of Australia\nCoaches of the Sri Lanka national cricket team"},

In his colophon he acknowledges the help he received from others in the preparation and correction of the text of Līlāvatīsāra.\n\nJinaratna in his introductory verses to Līlāvatīsāra describes how his interest in Jineshvara's poem was stimulated by his own teacher. Jinaratna states that he began to write his epitome at the request of those who wished to concentrate on its narrative alone.\n\nBy writing in Sanskrit, the pan-Indian language of learned discourse, Jinaratna gave Līlāvatīsāra a far wider readership than was possible for Jineshvara's , since it was written in the Prakrit Jain Maharashtri, a language with a more restricted currency.\n\nJinaratna displays his mastery of Sanskrit poetics by interspersing complex lyric metres throughout his poem. Not only does Jinaratna employ rare works and unusual grammatical forms drawn from the Sanskrit lexicons and grammars, but he also incorporates into his poem words taken from contemporary spoken vernaculars. Jinaratna's language in the narrative portions of the poem is fast moving and direct, but it is far more ornate in his descriptions of cities, mountains, desert wilderness, battles, festivals, and other topics with which a Sanskrit epic should be embellished.\n\nEnglish translations\nThe Clay Sanskrit Library has published a translation of Līlāvatīsāra by R.C.C.

{"id": "596706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas%20chromatography", "title": "Gas chromatography", "text": "Gas chromatography (GC) is a common type of chromatography used in analytical chemistry for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. Typical uses of GC include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture. In preparative chromatography, GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture.\n\nGas chromatography is also sometimes known as vapor-phase chromatography (VPC), or gas–liquid partition chromatography (GLPC). These alternative names, as well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently used in scientific literature.\n\nGas chromatography is the process of separating compounds in a mixture by injecting a gaseous or liquid sample into a mobile phase, typically called the carrier gas, and passing the gas through a stationary phase. The mobile phase is usually an inert gas or an unreactive gas such as helium, argon,  nitrogen or hydrogen. The stationary phase is a microscopic layer of viscous liquid on a surface of solid particles on an inert solid support inside a piece of glass or metal tubing called a column. The surface of the solid particles may also act as the stationary phase in some columns.  The glass or metal column through which the gas phase passes is located in an oven where the temperature of the gas can be controlled and the eluent coming off the column is monitored by a computerized detector.\n\nOperating Principle \n\nA gas chromatograph is made of a narrow tube, known as the column, through which the vaporized sample passes, carried along by a continuous flow of inert or nonreactive gas. Components of the sample pass through the column at different rates, depending on their chemical and physical properties and the resulting interactions with the column lining or filling, called the stationary phase. The column is typically enclosed within a temperature controlled oven. As the chemicals exit the end of the column, they are detected and identified electronically.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\nChromatography dates to 1903 in the work of the Russian scientist, Mikhail Semenovich Tswett, who separated plant pigments via liquid column chromatography.\n\nInvention\nThe invention of gas chromatography is generally attributed to Anthony T. James and Archer J.P. Martin. Their gas chromatograph used partition chromatography as the separating principle, rather than adsorption chromatography. The popularity of gas chromatography quickly rose after the development of the flame ionization detector.\nMartin and another one of their colleagues, Richard Synge, with whom he shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, had noted in an earlier paper that chromatography might also be used to separate gases. Synge pursued other work while Martin continued his work with James.\n\nGas Adsorption Chromatography Precursors\nGerman physical chemist Erika Cremer in 1947 together with Austrian graduate student Fritz Prior developed what could be considered the first gas chromatograph that consisted of a carrier gas, a column packed with silica gel, and a thermal conductivity detector. They exhibited the chromatograph at ACHEMA in Frankfurt, but nobody was interested in it.\nN.C. Turner with the Burrell Corporation introduced in 1943 a massive instrument that used a charcoal column and mercury vapors. Stig Claesson of Uppsala University published in 1946 his work on a charcoal column that also used mercury.\nGerhard Hesse, while a professor at the University of Marburg/Lahn decided to test the prevailing opinion among German chemists that molecules could not be separated in a moving gas stream. He set up a simple glass column filled with starch and successfully separated bromine and iodine using nitrogen as the carrier gas. He then built a system that flowed an inert gas through a glass condenser packed with silica gel and collected the eluted fractions.\nCourtenay S.G Phillips of Oxford University investigated separation in a charcoal column using a thermal conductivity detector. He consulted with Claesson and decided to use displacement as his separating principle. After learning about the results of James and Martin, he switched to partition chromatography.\n\nColumn Technology\nEarly gas chromatography used packed columns, made of tubing typically 1-5m long, 1-5mm diameter, and filled with particles. The resolution of packed columns was improved by the invention of capillary column, in which the stationary phase is coated on the inner wall of the capillary.\n\nPhysical components\n\nAutosamplers \n\nThe autosampler provides the means to introduce a sample automatically into the inlets. Manual insertion of the sample is possible but is no longer common. Automatic insertion provides better reproducibility and time-optimization.Different kinds of autosamplers exist. Autosamplers can be classified in relation to sample capacity (auto-injectors vs. autosamplers, where auto-injectors can work a small number of samples), to robotic technologies (XYZ robot vs. rotating robot – the most common), or to analysis:\n\n Liquid\n Static head-space by syringe technology\n Dynamic head-space by transfer-line technology\n Solid phase microextraction (SPME)\n\nInlets \n\nThe column inlet (or injector) provides the means to introduce a sample into a continuous flow of carrier gas. The inlet is a piece of hardware attached to the column head.\n\nCommon inlet types are:\n S/SL (split/splitless) injector; a sample is introduced into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a septum – the heat facilitates volatilization of the sample and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (splitless mode) or a portion (split mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, a part of the sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the split vent. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (>0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes (<0.01%). In splitless mode the split valve opens after a pre-set amount of time to purge heavier elements that would otherwise contaminate the system. This pre-set (splitless) time should be optimized, the shorter time (e.g., 0.2 min) ensures less tailing but loss in response, the longer time (2 min) increases tailing but also signal.\n On-column inlet; the sample is here introduced directly into the column in its entirety without heat, or at a temperature below the boiling point of the solvent. The low temperature condenses the sample into a narrow zone. The column and inlet can then be heated, releasing the sample into the gas phase. This ensures the lowest possible temperature for chromatography and keeps samples from decomposing above their boiling point.\n PTV injector; Temperature-programmed sample introduction was first described by Vogt in 1979. Originally Vogt developed the technique as a method for the introduction of large sample volumes (up to 250 µL) in capillary GC. Vogt introduced the sample into the liner at a controlled injection rate. The temperature of the liner was chosen slightly below the boiling point of the solvent. The low-boiling solvent was continuously evaporated and vented through the split line. Based on this technique, Poy developed the programmed temperature vaporising injector; PTV. By introducing the sample at a low initial liner temperature many of the disadvantages of the classic hot injection techniques could be circumvented.\n Gas source inlet or gas switching valve; gaseous samples in collection bottles are connected to what is most commonly a six-port switching valve.  The carrier gas flow is not interrupted while a sample can be expanded into a previously evacuated sample loop. Upon switching, the contents of the sample loop are inserted into the carrier gas stream.\n P/T (Purge-and-Trap) system;  An inert gas is bubbled through an aqueous sample causing insoluble volatile chemicals to be purged from the matrix.  The volatiles are 'trapped' on an absorbent column (known as a trap or concentrator) at ambient temperature.  The trap is then heated and the volatiles are directed into the carrier gas stream.  Samples requiring preconcentration or purification can be introduced via such a system, usually hooked up to the S/SL port.\n\nThe choice of carrier gas (mobile phase) is important.  Hydrogen has a range of flow rates that are comparable to helium in efficiency.  However, helium may be more efficient and provide the best separation if flow rates are optimized. Helium is non-flammable and works with a greater number of detectors and older instruments.  Therefore, helium is the most common carrier gas used.  However, the price of helium has gone up considerably over recent years, causing an increasing number of chromatographers to switch to hydrogen gas.  Historical use, rather than rational consideration, may contribute to the continued preferential use of helium.\n\nDetectors \n\nCommonly used detectors are the flame ionization detector (FID) and the thermal conductivity detector (TCD).  While TCDs are beneficial in that they are non-destructive, its low detection limit for most analytes inhibits widespread use. FIDs are sensitive primarily to hydrocarbons, and are more sensitive to them than TCD.  FIDs cannot detect water or carbon dioxide which make them ideal for environmental organic analyte analysis. FID is two to three times more sensitive to analyte detection than TCD.\n\nThe TCD relies on the thermal conductivity of matter passing around a thin wire of tungsten-rhenium with a current traveling through it. In this set up helium or nitrogen serve as the carrier gas because of their relatively high thermal conductivity which keep the filament cool and maintain uniform resistivity and electrical efficiency of the filament. When analyte molecules elute from the column, mixed with carrier gas, the thermal conductivity decreases while there is an increase in filament temperature and resistivity resulting in fluctuations in voltage ultimately causing a detector response.  Detector sensitivity is proportional to filament current while it is inversely proportional to the immediate environmental temperature of that detector as well as flow rate of the carrier gas.\n\nIn a flame ionization detector (FID), electrodes are placed adjacent to a flame fueled by hydrogen / air near the exit of the column, and when carbon containing compounds exit the column they are pyrolyzed by the flame. This detector works only for organic / hydrocarbon containing compounds due to the ability of the carbons to form cations and electrons upon pyrolysis which generates a current between the electrodes.  The increase in current is translated and appears as a peak in a chromatogram. FIDs have low detection limits (a few picograms per second) but they are unable to generate ions from carbonyl containing carbons. FID compatible carrier gasses include helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon.\n\nIn FID, sometimes the stream is modified before entering the detector. A methanizer converts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into methane so that it can be detected. A different technology is the polyarc, by Activated Research Inc, that converts all compounds to methane.\n\nAlkali flame detector (AFD) or alkali flame ionization detector (AFID) has high sensitivity to nitrogen and phosphorus, similar to NPD. However, the alkaline metal ions are supplied with the hydrogen gas, rather than a bead above the flame. For this reason AFD does not suffer the 'fatigue' of the NPD, but provides a constant sensitivity over long period of time. In addition, when alkali ions are not added to the flame, AFD operates like a standard FID. A catalytic combustion detector (CCD) measures combustible hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Discharge ionization detector (DID) uses a high-voltage electric discharge to produce ions.\n\nFlame photometric detector (FPD) uses a photomultiplier tube to detect spectral lines of the compounds as they are burned in a flame. Compounds eluting off the column are carried into a hydrogen fueled flame which excites specific elements in the molecules, and the excited elements (P,S, Halogens, Some Metals) emit light of specific characteristic wavelengths. The emitted light is filtered and detected by a photomultiplier tube. In particular, phosphorus emission is around 510–536 nm and sulfur emission is at 394 nm. With an atomic emission detector (AED), a sample eluting from a column enters a chamber which is energized by microwaves that induce a plasma. The plasma causes the analyte sample to decompose and certain elements generate an atomic emission spectra. The atomic emission spectra is diffracted by a diffraction grating and detected by a series of photomultiplier tubes or photo diodes.\n\nElectron capture detector (ECD) uses a radioactive beta particle (electron) source to measure the degree of electron capture. ECD are used for the detection of molecules containing electronegative / withdrawing elements and functional groups like halogens, carbonyl, nitriles, nitro groups, and organometalics. In this type of detector either nitrogen or 5% methane in argon is used as the mobile phase carrier gas. The carrier gas passes between two electrodes placed at the end of the column, and adjacent to the cathode (negative electrode) resides a radioactive foil such as 63Ni. The radioactive foil emits a beta particle (electron) which collides with and ionizes the carrier gas to generate more ions resulting in a current. When analyte molecules with electronegative / withdrawing elements or functional groups electrons are captured which results in a decrease in current generating a detector response.\n\nNitrogen–phosphorus detector (NPD), a form of thermionic detector where nitrogen and phosphorus alter the work function on a specially coated bead and a resulting current is measured.\n\nDry electrolytic conductivity detector (DELCD) uses an air phase and high temperature (v. Coulsen) to measure chlorinated compounds.\n\nMass spectrometer (MS), also called GC-MS; highly effective and sensitive, even in a small quantity of sample. This detector can be used to identify the analytes in chromatograms by their mass spectrum. Some GC-MS are connected to an NMR spectrometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR. Some GC-MS-NMR are connected to an infrared spectrophotometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR-IR. It must, however, be stressed this is very rare as most analyses needed can be concluded via purely GC-MS.\n\nVacuum ultraviolet (VUV) represents the most recent development in gas chromatography detectors. Most chemical species absorb and have unique gas phase absorption cross sections in the approximately 120–240 nm VUV wavelength range monitored. Where absorption cross sections are known for analytes, the VUV detector is capable of absolute determination (without calibration) of the number of molecules present in the flow cell in the absence of chemical interferences.\n\nOlfactometric detector, also called GC-O, uses a human assessor to analyse the odour activity of compounds. With an odour port or a sniffing port, the quality of the odour, the intensity of the odour and the duration of the odour activity of a compound can be assessed.\n\nOther detectors include the Hall electrolytic conductivity detector (ElCD), helium ionization detector (HID), infrared detector (IRD), photo-ionization detector (PID), pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD), and thermionic ionization detector (TID).\n\nMethods \n\nThe method is the collection of conditions in which the GC operates for a given analysis.  Method development is the process of determining what conditions are adequate and/or ideal for the analysis required.\n\nConditions which can be varied to accommodate a required analysis include inlet temperature, detector temperature, column temperature and temperature program, carrier gas and carrier gas flow rates, the column's stationary phase, diameter and length, inlet type and flow rates, sample size and injection technique.  Depending on the detector(s) (see below) installed on the GC, there may be a number of detector conditions that can also be varied.  Some GCs also include valves which can change the route of sample and carrier flow. The timing of the opening and closing of these valves can be important to method development.\n\nCarrier gas selection and flow rates \nTypical carrier gases include helium, nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen.  Which gas to use is usually determined by the detector being used, for example, a DID requires helium as the carrier gas.  When analyzing gas samples the carrier is also selected based on the sample's matrix, for example, when analyzing a mixture in argon, an argon carrier is preferred because the argon in the sample does not show up on the chromatogram. Safety and availability can also influence carrier selection.\n\nThe purity of the carrier gas is also frequently determined by the detector, though the level of sensitivity needed can also play a significant role.  Typically, purities of 99.995% or higher are used.  The most common purity grades required by modern instruments for the majority of sensitivities are 5.0 grades, or 99.999% pure meaning that there is a total of 10 ppm of impurities in the carrier gas that could affect the results.  The highest purity grades in common use are 6.0 grades, but the need for detection at very low levels in some forensic and environmental applications has driven the need for carrier gases at 7.0 grade purity and these are now commercially available.  Trade names for typical purities include 'Zero Grade,' 'Ultra-High Purity (UHP) Grade,' '4.5 Grade' and '5.0 Grade.'\n\nThe carrier gas linear velocity affects the analysis in the same way that temperature does (see above).  The higher the linear velocity the faster the analysis, but the lower the separation between analytes.  Selecting the linear velocity is therefore the same compromise between the level of separation and length of analysis as selecting the column temperature. The linear velocity will be implemented by means of the carrier gas flow rate, with regards to the inner diameter of the column.\n\nWith GCs made before the 1990s, carrier flow rate was controlled indirectly by controlling the carrier inlet pressure, or 'column head pressure.'  The actual flow rate was measured at the outlet of the column or the detector with an electronic flow meter, or a bubble flow meter, and could be an involved, time consuming, and frustrating process.  It was not possible to vary the pressure setting during the run, and thus the flow was essentially constant during the analysis. The relation between flow rate and inlet pressure is calculated with Poiseuille's equation for compressible fluids.\n\nMany modern GCs, however, electronically measure the flow rate, and electronically control the carrier gas pressure to set the flow rate.  Consequently, carrier pressures and flow rates can be adjusted during the run, creating pressure/flow programs similar to temperature programs.\n\nStationary compound selection \nThe polarity of the solute is crucial for the choice of stationary compound, which in an optimal case would have a similar polarity as the solute. Common stationary phases in open tubular columns are cyanopropylphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane, carbowax polyethyleneglycol, biscyanopropyl cyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane and diphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane. For packed columns more options are available.\n\nInlet types and flow rates \nThe choice of inlet type and injection technique depends on if the sample is in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present that has to be vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas switching valve system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) desorption apparatus such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the injector (SPME applications).\n\nSample size and injection technique\n\nSample injection \n\nThe real chromatographic analysis starts with the introduction of the sample onto the column. The development of capillary gas chromatography resulted in many practical problems with the injection technique. The technique of on-column injection, often used with packed columns, is usually not possible with capillary columns. In the injection system in the capillary gas chromatograph the amount injected should not overload the column and\nthe width of the injected plug should be small compared to the spreading due to the chromatographic process. Failure to comply with this latter requirement will reduce the separation capability of the column. As a general rule, the volume injected, Vinj, and the volume of the detector cell, Vdet, should be about 1/10 of the volume occupied by the portion of sample containing the molecules of interest (analytes) when they exit the column.\n\nSome general requirements which a good injection technique should fulfill are that it should be possible to obtain the column's optimum separation efficiency, it should allow accurate and reproducible injections of small amounts of representative samples, it should induce no change in sample composition, it should not exhibit discrimination based on differences in boiling point, polarity, concentration or thermal/catalytic stability, and it should be applicable for trace analysis as well as for undiluted samples.\n\nHowever, there are a number of problems inherent in the use of syringes for injection. Even the best syringes claim an accuracy of only 3%, and in unskilled hands, errors are much larger. The needle may cut small pieces of rubber from the septum as it injects sample through it. These can block the needle and prevent the syringe filling the next time it is used. It may not be obvious that this has happened. A fraction of the sample may get trapped in the rubber, to be released during subsequent injections. This can give rise to ghost peaks in the chromatogram. There may be selective loss of the more volatile components of the sample by evaporation from the tip of the needle.\n\nColumn selection \nThe choice of column depends on the sample and the active measured. The main chemical attribute regarded when choosing a column is the polarity of the mixture, but functional groups can play a large part in column selection. The polarity of the sample must closely match the polarity of the column stationary phase to increase resolution and separation while reducing run time. The separation and run time also depends on the film thickness (of the stationary phase), the column diameter and the column length.\n\nColumn temperature and temperature program \n\nThe column(s) in a GC are contained in an oven, the temperature of which is precisely controlled electronically.  (When discussing the 'temperature of the column,' an analyst is technically referring to the temperature of the column oven.  The distinction, however, is not important and will not subsequently be made in this article.)\n\nThe rate at which a sample passes through the column is directly proportional to the temperature of the column.  The higher the column temperature, the faster the sample moves through the column.  However, the faster a sample moves through the column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.\n\nIn general, the column temperature is selected to compromise between the length of the analysis and the level of separation.\n\nA method which holds the column at the same temperature for the entire analysis is called 'isothermal.'  Most methods, however, increase the column temperature during the analysis, the initial temperature, rate of temperature increase (the temperature 'ramp'), and final temperature are called the temperature program.\n\nA temperature program allows analytes that elute early in the analysis to separate adequately, while shortening the time it takes for late-eluting analytes to pass through the column.\n\nData reduction and analysis\n\nQualitative analysis \n\nGenerally, chromatographic data is presented as a graph of detector response (y-axis) against retention time (x-axis), which is called a chromatogram.  This provides a spectrum of peaks for a sample representing the analytes present in a sample eluting from the column at different times.  Retention time can be used to identify analytes if the method conditions are constant.  Also, the pattern of peaks will be constant for a sample under constant conditions and can identify complex mixtures of analytes. However, in most modern applications, the GC is connected to a mass spectrometer or similar detector that is capable of identifying the analytes represented by the peaks.\n\nQuantitative analysis \n\nThe area under a peak is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the chromatogram.  By calculating the area of the peak using the mathematical function of integration, the concentration of an analyte in the original sample can be determined.  Concentration can be calculated using a calibration curve created by finding the response for a series of concentrations of analyte, or by determining the relative response factor of an analyte.  The relative response factor is the expected ratio of an analyte to an internal standard (or external standard) and is calculated by finding the response of a known amount of analyte and a constant amount of internal standard (a chemical added to the sample at a constant concentration, with a distinct retention time to the analyte).\n\nIn most modern GC-MS systems, computer software is used to draw and integrate peaks, and match MS spectra to library spectra.\n\nApplications \nIn general, substances that vaporize below 300°C (and therefore are stable up to that temperature) can be measured quantitatively. The samples are also required to be salt-free; they should not contain ions. Very minute amounts of a substance can be measured, but it is often required that the sample must be measured in comparison to a sample containing the pure, suspected substance known as a reference standard.\n\nVarious temperature programs can be used to make the readings more meaningful; for example to differentiate between substances that behave similarly during the GC process.\n\nProfessionals working with GC analyze the content of a chemical product, for example in assuring the quality of products in the chemical industry; or measuring chemicals in soil, air or water, such as soil gases. GC is very accurate if used properly and can measure picomoles of a substance in a 1 ml liquid sample, or parts-per-billion concentrations in gaseous samples.\n\nIn practical courses at colleges, students sometimes get acquainted to the GC by studying the contents of Lavender oil or measuring the ethylene that is secreted by Nicotiana benthamiana plants after artificially injuring their leaves. These GC analyse hydrocarbons (C2-C40+). In a typical experiment, a packed column is used to separate the light gases, which are then detected with a TCD.  The hydrocarbons are separated using a capillary column and detected with a FID.  A complication with light gas analyses that include H2 is that He, which is the most common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted).  For this reason, dual TCD instruments used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common.  Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than two separate ones.  The sensitivity is reduced, but this is a trade off for simplicity in the gas supply.\n\nGas chromatography is used extensively in forensic science. Disciplines as diverse as solid drug dose (pre-consumption form) identification and quantification, arson investigation, paint chip analysis, and toxicology cases, employ GC to identify and quantify various biological specimens and crime-scene evidence.\n\nSee also \nAnalytical chemistry\nChromatography\nGas chromatography–mass spectrometry\nGas chromatography-olfactometry\nHigh-performance liquid chromatography\nInverse gas chromatography\nProton transfer reaction mass spectrometry\nSecondary electrospray ionization\nSelected ion flow tube mass spectrometry\nStandard addition\nThin layer chromatography\nUnresolved complex mixture\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nChromatographic Columns in the Chemistry LibreTexts Library\n\n \nLaboratory techniques"},

The OAU aimed to promote cooperation between African states. The 1980 Lagos Plan of Action was adopted by the organization. The plan suggested Africa should minimize reliance upon the West by promoting intra-African trade. This began as the creation of a number of regional cooperation organizations in the different regions of Africa, such as the Southern African Development Coordination Conference. Eventually this led to the Abuja Treaty in 1991, which created the African Economic Community, an organization that promoted the development of free trade areas, customs unions, an African Central Bank, and an African common currency union.\n\nIn 2002, the OAU was succeeded by the African Union (AU), which had as one of its goals to accelerate the 'economic integration of the continent'.  A second goal was to 'coordinate and harmonize the policies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union.'\n\nNegotiations\n\nAt the 2012 African Union summit in Addis Ababa, leaders agreed to create a new Continental Free Trade Area by 2017. At the 2015 AU summit in Johannesburg, the summit agreed to commence negotiations. This began a series of ten negotiating sessions which took place over the next three years.\n\nThe first negotiation forum was held in February 2016 and held eight meetings until the Summit in March 2018 in Kigali. From February 2017 on the technical working groups held four meetings, where technical issues were discussed and implemented in the draft. On March 8–9, 2018 the African Union Ministers of Trade approved the draft.\n\n2018 Kigali Summit\n\nIn March 2018, at the 10th Extraordinary Session of the African Union on AfCFTA, three separate agreements were signed: the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the Kigali Declaration; and the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons.  The Protocol on Free Movement of Persons seeks to establish a visa-free zone within the AfCFTA countries, and support the creation of the African Union Passport.  At the summit in Kigali on 21 March 2018, 44 countries signed the AfCFTA, 47 signed the Kigali Declaration, and 30 signed the Protocol on Free Movement of People.  While a success, there were two notable holdouts: Nigeria and South Africa, the two largest economies in Africa.\n\nOne complicating factor in the negotiations was that Africa had already been divided into eight separate free trade areas and/or customs unions, each with different regulations. These regional bodies will continue to exist; the African Continental Free Trade Agreement initially seeks to reduce trade barriers between the different pillars of the African Economic Community, and eventually use these regional organizations as building blocks for the ultimate goal of an Africa-wide customs union.\n\nDrafting of further protocols\nNegotiations continued in 2018 with Phase II, including policies of investment, competition and intellectual property rights. In January 2020, AU Assembly negotiations are envisaged to be concluded. A draft is expected for the January 2020 AU Assembly.\n\nInstitutions\nThe following institutions were established to facilitate the implementation of the free trade area. As a result of Phase II negotiations more committees may be established via protocols.\n\nThe AfCFTA Secretariat will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of the agreement and shall be an autonomous body within the AU system. Though it will have independent legal personality, it shall work closely with the AU Commission and receive its budget from the AU. The Council of Ministers responsible for trade will decide on the location of the headquarter, structure, role and responsibilities.\nThe Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government is the highest decision-making body. It is likely to meet during the AU Summits. The Council of Ministers Responsible for Trade provides strategic trade policy oversight and ensures effective implementation and enforcement of the AfCFTA Agreement.\n\nSeveral committees have been established, for trade in goods, trade in services, on rules of origin, trade remedies, non-tariff barriers, technical barriers to trade and on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Dispute resolution rules and procedures are still being negotiated, but will presumably include designation of a dispute resolution body. The Committee of Senior Trade Officials implements the Council's decisions. The Committee is responsible for the development of programs and action plans for the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement.\n\nImplementation \n\nThe AfCFTA is set to be implemented in phases, and some of the future phases still under negotiation.\n\nAt the Kigali summit, areas of agreement were found on trade protocols, dispute settlement procedures, customs cooperation, trade facilitation, and rules of origin.  This was part of Phase I of the agreement, which covers goods and services liberalization.  There was also agreement to reduce tariffs on 90% of all goods.  Each nation is permitted to exclude 3% of goods from this agreement.\n\nThe 12th Extraordinary Session of the African Union on AfCFTA was called to launch the new agreement into its operational phase, which was hosted in Niamey on 7 July 2019.\n\nAt its launch, five operational instruments that will govern the AfCFTA were activated: 'the rules of origin; the online negotiating forum; the monitoring and elimination of non-tariff barriers; a digital payment system; and the African Trade Observatory.'\n\nSome Phase One issues that remain to be negotiated include the schedule of tariff concessions and other specific commitments.  Negotiations are also underway to see which city will host the AfCFTA.\n\nNegotiations for Phase II began in February 2019.  These negotiations will cover protocols for competition, intellectual property, and investment.  Negotiations on Phase II issues are expected to finish in 2020.\n\nAfter months of delay because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa, the AfCFTA officially but largely symbolically launched on January 1, 2021.\n\nMembership\n\nAs of July 2019, 54 of the 55 African Union states had signed the agreement, with Eritrea the only country not signing the agreement. Of these member states 27 have deposited their instrument of ratification.\n\nAfter the Kigali summit, more signatures were added to the AfCFTA.  At the African Union summit in Nouakchott on 1 July 2018, five more nations joined the agreement, including South Africa.  Kenya and Ghana were the first nations to ratify the agreement, depositing their ratification on 10 May 2018.  Of the signatories, 22 needed to ratify the agreement for it to come into effect, and this occurred on 29 April 2019 when both Sierra Leone and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic ratified the agreement. As a result, the agreement came into force 30 days later on 30 May 2019; at this point, only Benin, Nigeria, and Eritrea had not signed.  Outstanding issues like the trade concession agreements and rules of origin remain under negotiation.\n\nEritrea was not part of the initial agreement due to an ongoing state of war, but the 2018 peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea ended the conflict and ended the barrier to Eritrean participation in the free trade agreement. \n\nAt this summit, Benin and Nigeria signed the agreement, leaving Eritrea as the only African state not a part of this agreement; Eritrea has since asked to join the agreement. Gabon and Equatorial Guinea also deposited their ratification at this summit.  At the date of the launch, there were 27 states who had ratified the agreement.\n\nSouth Africa, Sierra Leone, Namibia, Lesotho and Burundi have since signed the AfCFTA during the 31st African Union Summit in Nouakchott. As of July 2019, 54 states have signed the agreement.\n\nNigerian opposition  \n\nNigeria was one of the last nations to sign the agreement. At 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and has about the population of the second and third most-populous countries, Ethiopia and Egypt, combined, each of which have a population around 98 million. With a nominal GDP of US$376 billion, or around 17% of Africa's GDP, it is just ahead of South Africa, which accounts for 16% of Africa's economy. Because Nigeria is such a significant country in terms of its population and its economy, its absence at the initial signing of the agreement was particularly conspicuous. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa underscored that in comments on 12 July 2018 and commented, 'The continent is waiting for Nigeria and South Africa. By trading among ourselves, we are able to retain more resources in the continent.' South Africa later signed the agreement.\n\n44 countries initially signed the agreement on 21 March 2018. Nigeria was one of 11 African Union nations to avoid initially signing. At the time, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said that Nigeria could not do anything that would undermine local manufacturers and entrepreneurs. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, which represents 3,000 Nigerian manufacturers, praised the decision to back out of the agreement. The Nigerian foreign minister tweeted that more domestic consultation was needed before Nigeria could sign the agreement. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo said Nigeria's delay was regrettable. The Nigeria Labour Congress called the agreement a 'renewed, extremely dangerous and radioactive neoliberal policy initiative', suggesting increased economic pressure would pressure workers into migration under difficult and unsafe conditions.\n\nOn 21 July 2018, five more nations signed the agreement, including South Africa. At that time, the Nigerian government emphasized its non-participation was a delay, not a withdrawal, and promised to soon sign the agreement. As the foreign minister had earlier emphasized, the Nigerian government intended to consult further with local businesses in order to ensure private sector buy-in to the agreement.\n\nAs the Nigerian government continued to consult with local business groups in the latter half of 2018, a key concern was whether the agreement adequately prevented anti-competitive practices such as dumping. As 2018 drew to a close, former President Olusegun Obasanjo said the delay was 'regrettable', emphasizing the lack of trade in goods amongst African countries, the difficulties in travelling from one African country to another, and the colonial legacy which these restrictions on Africa's growth represented. The government steering committee in charge of the consultative process was due to release its report on the agreement in January 2019.\n\nNigeria's president announced on 2 July 2019 that Nigeria would sign the AfCFTA in Niger the following week. Nigeria signed the AfCFTA on 7 July 2019.\n\nCurrent Status\nMost AU member states have signed the agreement. Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, and Zambia did not initially sign the agreement. President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari was particularly reluctant to fearing it would hurt Nigerian entrepreneurship and local industries. On July 7, 2019 Nigeria and Benin committed to signing the Africa free trade at the 12th extraordinary session of the assembly of the union on AfCFTA; leaving Eritrea as the only nation out of the 55 African Union Member States not to sign up to the deal.\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area did not come into effect until 22 of the signing countries ratified the agreement, which occurred in April 2019 when The Gambia became the 22nd country to ratify it. As of August 2020, there are 54 signatories, of which at least 30 have ratified and 28 have deposited their instruments of ratification. The three countries that have ratified but not yet deposited their ratification are reported to be Cameroon, Angola, and Somalia though Morocco enacted a law authorizing ratification in 2019.\n\nList of signatories and parties to the agreement\n\nOther AU member states\n\nEritrea has not signed due to tensions with Ethiopia, but following the 2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit the AU Commissioner for Trade and Industry now expects Eritrea to sign the agreement.\n\nHuman rights assessment\nA July 2017 United Nations Economic Commission for Africa report argues that the CFTA may contribute to tackling poverty and inequality as its wide scope will facilitate structural changes in African economies. It is seen as a step towards meeting the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The document was targeted to ensuring human rights were considered within the negotiations.\n\nSee also\n\n Tripartite Free Trade Area\n Single African Air Transport Market\n Rules of Origin\n Market access\n Free-trade area\n Tariffs\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n UNCTAD on the CFTA\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) page on the Rules of Origin Facilitator, with member countries' status and access to legal documents.\n\nAfrican Union\nEconomy of the African Union\nFree trade agreements\n2018 in economics\n2018 in international relations\n2018 establishments in Africa\nTrade blocs\nPolitics of Nigeria\nPolitics of Africa\n2018 in Rwanda\nMarch 2018 events in Africa\n\nfr:Zone de libre-échange continentale africaine"},

The settlement is located on the Czerna Mała river, a tributary to the Bóbr, in the Silesian-Lusatian Lowlands. It is situated on the rim of the Lower Silesian Wilderness and just south of the future A18 autostrada.\n\nHistory\nThe settlement arose in the 10th century, at the crossroad of the trade routes from Görlitz to Żagań and from Guben to Legnica. The medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg (975–1018) mentioned a castle of Ilva, where in 1000 AD the Polish duke Bolesław I Chrobry met with Emperor Otto III on his journey from the canonization of Bishop Adalbert of Prague to the Congress of Gniezno. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, from the 12th century onwards, the border fortress was controlled by the Piast dukes of Silesia. Iłowa's inhabitants took part in the 1241 Battle of Legnica against the invading Mongols.\n\nIłowa itself is first documented in a 1356 deed by the Bohemian king and Emperor Charles IV, when he granted the fief of das halbe Dorf an der Czirne (i.e. half the village on the Czerna River, later called Halbau) at the border with the Silesian Duchy of Żagań to the Kotowice noble family. Mining and smelting of bog iron in the area is documented since the 15th century. The Kotowice family had a castle built here, that later became a notorious robber baron stronghold and was later destroyed by armed forces of the Lusatian League at the behest of the Görlitz citizens in 1440. The Kotowice dynasty sold the estates of Halbau together with neighbouring Konin to the Upper Lusatian state country of Königsbrück in 1567.\n\nAccording to an annex to the 1635 Peace of Prague, Iłowa together with Upper Lusatia passed from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown to the Wettin elector John George I of Saxony. Under the rule of his successor Elector John George II, a Protestant church was built and the settlement received town privileges in 1679. From 1682 it was incorporated as a southern exclave into the Lower Lusatian lordship of Żary held by the Promnitz noble family. Between 1697 and 1815 it was also under rule of Polish monarchs in personal union.\n\nAfter the Congress of Vienna the town was annexed by Prussia in 1815, and became part of the province of Silesia.\n\nDuring World War II a Nazi subcamp of Gross-Rosen was located here from 1944 to 1945. After Nazi Germany's defeat in the war the German population was evicted and the abandoned town once again became part of Poland. Iłowa's first post-war Polish wójt was Stefan Urbański, a former forced labourer returning from Germany.\n\nAfter the war the village Żaków and the eastern part of the village Karolinów have been incorporated into the town limits. Town privileges were restored in 1962.\n\nNotable people\nFriedrich Boser (1811–1881), artist\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nSee twin towns of Gmina Iłowa.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official town webpage\n\nCities and towns in Lubusz Voivodeship\nŻagań County"},

She has served in the Assembly of Vojvodina since 2020 as a member of the Serbian Progressive Party.\n\nPrivate career\nHrnjak was born in Kikinda, Vojvodina, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She graduated from the higher school for teacher education 'Zora Krdžalić Zaga' (1997) and the Faculty of Education in Sombor (1999). She lives in Kikinda.\n\nPolitician\n\nMunicipal politics\nHrnjak entered political life as a member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party, appearing in the eighteenth position on the party's electoral list in Kikinda for the 2008 Serbian local elections. The party won a plurality victory in the election and emerged as the dominant presence in a local coalition government; Hrnjak was appointed to the municipal council (i.e., the local government's executive branch) on 3 June 2008, with responsibility for information and social protection.\n\nThe Radical Party experienced a serious split later in the year, with several members joining the more moderate Progressive Party under the leadership of Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić. Hrnjak sided with the Progressives. The split in the Radicals prompted a turnover in the local government, and Hrnjak was removed from council on 17 October 2008.\n\nShe appeared in the third position on the Progressive Party's electoral list for Kikinda in the 2012 local elections and was elected to the municipal assembly when the list won twelve out of thirty-nine mandates. Following another turnover in the local government, she was re-appointed to council on 13 September 2013 with responsibility for education, culture, and information.\n\nHrnjak received the 218th position on the Progressive Party's Aleksandar Vučić — Future We Believe In list in the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election. This was too low a position for election to be a realistic prospect, and she was not elected even as the list won a majority victory with 158 out of 250 mandates.\n\nShe was given the thirty-second position on the Progressive list for Kikinda in the 2016 local elections. The list won a majority victory with twenty-six mandates, and she was not initially elected. She received a mandate on 6 October 2017 as the replacement for another party member and, on the same day, was appointed as president (i.e., speaker) of the city assembly. She held this role for the next three years and did not seek re-election at the city level in 2020.\n\nProvincial politics\nHrnjak sought election to the Assembly of Vojvodina in the 2012 provincial election, running as the Progressive Party candidate in Kikinda's first division. She was narrowly defeated in the second round. After this election, the province switched to a system of full proportional representation.\n\nShe received the forty-third position on the Progressive Party's Aleksandar Vučić — For Our Children list in the 2020 provincial election and was elected when the list won a majority victory with seventy-six out of 120 mandates. In October 2020, she was appointed as the president of the assembly committee for education and science.

The book attempts to strike a balance between being too mathematically rigorous and formal, and being so informal, practical, and hands-on that computer science theory is not taught.\n\nThe 'walls' of the title refer to the abstract data type (ADT) which has a wall between its public interface and private implementation. Early languages like Pascal did not build this wall very high; later languages like Modula-2 did create a much stronger wall between the two; and object-oriented languages such as C++ and Java implement walls using the class concept.\n\nThe 'mirrors' of the title refer to recursion. The idea is of looking at a reflection in two mirrors placed in opposition to one another, so a repeated image is reflected smaller and smaller in them.\n\nEditions \nThe first edition, which used the language Pascal, was published in 1986.\n\nAn edition that used Modula-2 was published in 1988. Modula-2 had much better support for the sort of ADT the book taught than Pascal.\n\nLater editions from the mid-1990s and the 2000s used C++ and Java, reflecting a fundamental shift in how computer science was taught.
